# CF Extensions PMC Notes

*Chat room:* go to [slack.cloudfoundry.org](https://slack.cloudfoundry.org) and then join the `#cf-extensions` channel

## New business

Attention all project leads, we have a new project that would like to be in
Extensions PMC https://github.com/pivotal/cloud-service-broker/

Please vote in the #cf-extensions poll ASAP about allowing this project to
skip the proposal process. The project is well enough defined already that a
proposal phase does not make sense. Omer Bensaadon is the project lead if you
have any questions.

We'll have another poll in a week to vote on accepting the project to the
Cloud Foundry Incubator under the Extensions PMC.
