# Projects

## _Incubating_

### CF Dev and Local (Scott, Stephen)

[add here]

### [Service Fabrik](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/service-fabrik-broker)

* Improvements of Interoperator, kubernetes based service broker for service operators.
* Improvement of service quota check during provisioning
* Code restructuring
* Bug fixes.

### [MultiApps](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/multiapps-cli-plugin)

#### New features:
* Keep original application names after blue-green deployment. Color suffixes -blue and -green will disappear! Try out the experimental blue-green technique with the new --strategy flag or stick with the stable one.

#### Usability improvements
* Download MTA operation logs with .log file extension and see them beautified in the preferred editor. Forget about MAIN_LOG and check the new OPERATION.log.
* Filter out MTA operations by MTA ID and get last deployment state easily in your CI pipeline. Try out command mta-ops with the new options  --mta and --last.
* Download operation logs by MTA ID. Stop searching for the long UUID representing the latest operation id! Use command  dmol with the combination of new options --mta and --last 1.
* Ownership validation is removed! Share one common service instance between several MTAs by default. The option --skip-ownership-validation does not take effect any more since it representes the new default behavior.

#### Bugfixes & other 
* Routes with bound services no longer prevent us from deleting applications.
* Several service brokers providing the same service offering led to non-deterministic service creation.
* The amount of CC calls for spaces with hundreds of apps/services is now minimal
