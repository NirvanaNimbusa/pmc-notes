# Projects

## _Incubating_

### CF Dev and Local (Scott, Stephen)

[add here]

### [Service Fabrik](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/service-fabrik-broker)

[add here]

### [MultiApps](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/multiapps-cli-plugin)

#### New Features
- Now MTA metadata is migrated from applications environment to CF v3 Metadata. You can expect faster MTA detection, especially on overloaded spaces. See all details with examples [here](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/xs2ds/team-documents/blob/master/mta-architecture/MTA_Metadata.md) This is a large step for us that not only improves performance but resolves numerous nasty issues as well, check resolves section here.
 
#### Upcoming
- Keep original application names after blue-green deployment. Color suffixes -blue and -green will disappear!
 
#### Usability improvements
- You will not see annoying attempts of retrying aborted processes. You know, ABORTED is a final state and cannot be moved.
- Get clear state which application services are updated. It was not visible which services are bound/unbound to an app at a time and it was veeery unpleasant for apps with many services!
 
##### Bugfixes
- Recently you could experience IPBased Rate Limit Exceeded to the controller. It was a bug in OSS cf-java-client and we fixed it.
- When bg-deploy process had been aborted, the next one would fail during starting application with “CF-NotStaged(170002): App has not finished staging”.
