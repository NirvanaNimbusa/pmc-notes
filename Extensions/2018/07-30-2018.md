# Projects

## _Incubating_

### App AutoScaler (Bo Yang)


- added built-in model for autoscaler besides deploying as a CF service
- Optimized database read/write perofrmance and improved scalability for metrics collection and event generator
- added deployment manifest for density deployment and deployment on Kubeternetes
- prototyped custom metrics support (introduced new component metrics forwarder)

### BBR (Therese and George)

- **[BBR v1.2.6](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-backup-and-restore/releases/tag/v1.2.6)** can access BOSH Directors behind SOCKS5 proxies.
- **Support for GCS-backed External Blobstores:** We finished and release most of the work for the GCS blobstore support as part of [SDK v1.9.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/backup-and-restore-sdk-release/releases/tag/v1.9.0). However, we realised that we have to rethink how to B+R GCS-backed blobstores because of the way object retention policy works in GCS. This feature is not ready for consumption.
- **Reduce Blobstore Backup Impact:** We started spiking on solutions for reducing the blobstore backup impact. Our focus is to reduce disk space requirements for the backup artifacts while keeping API downtime minimal. We are mostly looking at internal (WebDAV) blobstores.
