### CFCR (aka Kubo) (George Lestaris, Pivotal)

#### Whatâ€™s New:

##### We released v0.14. Highlights:
- Kubernetes v1.9.3
- Golang v1.9.4 (the one with the go get CVE fix)
- vCenter passwords with special characters (&, #, etc) can now be used with CFCR without breaking the deployment
- Etcd Track Kickoff
- The team has already picked up the first stories.
- New Etcd BOSH Release

##### This Week:

- We will keep working on automating component upgrades:
- This reduces the cost of picking up new releases while ensuring that we stay up to date with latest CVE fixes and features.
- We will keep working on the new Etcd BOSH Release.
- We concluded a spike to use TLS bootstrapping yesterday. This should unblock adopting the last few CIS recommendations.
