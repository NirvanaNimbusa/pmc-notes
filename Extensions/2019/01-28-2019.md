### Stratos (Neil)

- 2.3.0 Release coming this week [Release Notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/stratos/releases/tag/2.3.0)
- Working with the Autoscaler team as they add Autoscaler UI into Stratos
- Adding ability to invite users to an CF Org
- Looking into the V3 API and how it would support our use cases in the UI

### MultiApps (Nikolay)

Feature increment:
- Support for docker image deployment modelling
- Support for one-off task execution modelling
- Ignore ownership checks feature released to cover development-time sharing of apps and services between MultiApps. This is not recommended for productive usage as the feature breaks MultiApp integrity
- New MultiApp assembly tool - "mbt assemble"
