## Announcements


## PMC Lifecycle Activities
* Proposal: [Move BPM to active projects](https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/g/cf-bosh/message/2589)
  * Decision: Moved to active projects!

## Discussion
* BOSH team situation San Francisco/Toronto
  * Fred, the former PM of the BOSH Toronto team has left Pivotal
  * Pivotal merged the teams in Toronto and San Francisco
  * At the same time, split out a new team called 'BOSH Systems', responsible for agent, stemcell, bosh-dns and the CLI
  * These changes are still tentative, official communication follows if it proves to be beneficial internally

* AliCloud light Stemcells: [Questions about lifecycle and publication](https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/g/cf-bosh/message/2602)
  * Pipelines for stemcells are currently maintained by the newly created BOSH Systems team, they seem to be a good starting point to talk to
  * Morgan brings this to their attention and they will reach out to the AliCloud colleagues

* AliCloud CPI: [Questions about certification](https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/g/cf-bosh/message/2603)
  * Typically, development teams of CPIs own their own concourse, pipelines and infrastructure accounts
  * There is https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/bosh-cpi-certification which holds the current set of pipelines used to test AWS, Azure, GCP and vSphere CPIs
  * In cases of detailed questions, join #bosh on cloudfoundry slack and we will try to help out
