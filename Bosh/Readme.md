BOSH PMC meetings take place on the third Thursday of a month.
We meet at 8AM Pacific Time in http://zoom.bosh.io
Feel free to join, listen in and discuss with us. 

If you want to see topics discussed at the meeting, we appreciate a heads-up a few days *before* the meeting, either via mail on cf-bosh@lists.cloudfoundry.org or by making a pull request to the agenda document.
