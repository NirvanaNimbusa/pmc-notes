## Announcements
* New face: A William Martin from BOSH Windows. Hi!

## PMC Lifecycle Activities
* Renamed CF Containerization to "Project Quarks"
  * Chris Clark reaches out to Vlad for further coordination around git repositories and https://www.cloudfoundry.org/projects

## Discussion
* Should we move to a well-defined process for feature lifecycle?
  * alpha, beta, general availability (GA), similar to k8s
  * requires predictable release cadence for 'major' releases
  * general policy: new features get feature flags which are disabled at first and eventually get enabled by default
* Potential benefits
  * expectation management for consumers of BOSH
  * allows for a defined process of gathering feedback for development teams
    * see e.g. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-versioning
* Agreement: we don't need a more formal way of graduating features, a more detailed explanation of what it means to mark features as 'beta' would be really helpful, though
  * Currently, this means: we do have concrete teams in mind which want to try a certain feature. Feel free to try this feature yourself, but careful with production use – it might likely change
* No need for predictable release cadence in BOSH for now. Current approach of releasing on demand is good enough
