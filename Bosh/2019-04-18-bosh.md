# BOSH PMC Meeting 2019-04-18

## Agenda

* Announcements
* PMC Lifecycle Activities
* Backlog Review
* Any other topics?

## Announcements
* New face: A William Martin from BOSH Windows. Hi!

## PMC Lifecycle Activities
* Rename CF Containerization to "Project Quarks"

## Discussion
* Should we move to a well-defined process for feature lifecycle?
  * alpha, beta, general availability (GA), similar to k8s
  * requires predictable release cadence for 'major' releases
  * general policy: new features get feature flags which are disabled at first and eventually get enabled by default
* Potential benefits
  * expectation management for consumers of BOSH
  * allows for a defined process of gathering feedback for development teams
    * see e.g. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-versioning
