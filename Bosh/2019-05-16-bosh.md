### BOSH Core SF - Morgan Fine
* Two teams: bosh director and bosh systems
  * Systems team: stemcells, agent, cli
     * Released bosh-dns 1.11, which supports per-link healthiness
  * Released xenial 315
  * Started creating bionic stemcell line to support newest SSL versions
    * Seems to block mTLS for diego database
  * Change the way how blobstore credentials are passed to the agent
 * Director team: all the rest
   * Released 269.1.0
   * Pre-stop update, better than drain!
   * Exported_from section in the manifest. Avoids unexpected updates
   * Parallel resurrection work done by BOSH Team Europe
   * Working on improvements on start, stop, recreate: unexpected behavior touching entire deployment
   * Working on removing support of v1 manifests
   * BOSH HA
     * Short-term: strong backup-recovery story
     * Re-build for the blobstore:
     * Might also fix [#2143](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh/issues/2143) on the way
     * Long-term: maybe full HA BOSH
     * In-between: inner-outer bosh, multiple create-env, different stuff?
