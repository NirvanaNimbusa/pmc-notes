## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau

- we published CLI release [`6.45.0`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.45.0) which contains support for `cf oauth-token` and work toward supporting client credentials. See the release notes about the known issue with the log-cache plugin. 
- we distributed our CLI v6 deprecation [notice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kX-UbQzz7y41sgK979Zk_IHISQwfSH0vBT27mIeqo5Q/edit) recently. Please read and provide feedback - see in particular "Phase 1: New features primarily added to V7"
- the CLI team completed a series of workshop to build a team vision and roadmap. We hope to provide a place for the open source community to view these outputs
- current work: xteam with the loggregator team to deprecate the trafficcontroller, finishing the `cf l` refactoring, labels feature

**VAT**
- continuing on converting `v2` routes to `v3` and the CLI support for it
- continuing updating push for parity with v6 cli 
- started work on rolling deployments on v7 push
