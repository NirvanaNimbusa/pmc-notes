- Enable `cf ssh` for Windows+Linux with 3rd Party Network Plugins. Currently cf ssh to Windows apps on foundations with this configuration does not work. (https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/166248132)
- Fixed a bug whereby BBS was failing to run convergence on desired LRP's that > 283 instances (https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/166246984)

- Provide the auctioneer with more accurate diego-cell disk capacity information to be used in placement decisions
