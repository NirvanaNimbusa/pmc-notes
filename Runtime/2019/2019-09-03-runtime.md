## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau

**V6**

- published [`6.46.1`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.46.1) which includes the deprecation notice for domains, hostnames, and route path in favor of `routes` in the manifest. Also reaching out to the Community for [feedback](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EoFiJrL-2-Vhnc5E9GaJ-U6zy0JhSD2dOqX8FFfRHk4/edit), it looks likely, from the feedback, that we will implement the ability to override `host` and possibly `route` on `cf push` on v7 beta CLI. 
- working toward publishing 6.47.0 which will include refactoring of `cf login` and the command will also call v3 only endpoints

**V7**

- published [v7.24.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v7.0.0-beta.24) which is a publically consummable release of the v7 cf CLI - it includes a `push` completely backed by v3, rolling deployments on `push`, metadata, and [more](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v7.0.0-beta.24)
- working on user-related commands
- working toward publishing v7.25.0 which will include bug fixes on `cf push`, user and role-related commands
- we will also be working on `cf restart` and converting the command to use rolling deployments by default

- Support [AWS ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) integration. -- [tracker story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/168209772)

- Configurable graceful shutdown
- **on-hold depending on outcome from CAPI spike to provide feature support without requiring changes to Diego**
