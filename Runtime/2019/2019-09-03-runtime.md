- Provide accurate resource accounting on diego-cells when in OCI-mode. -- [tracker story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/167261902)
- Subtract Garden's `grootfs.reserved_space_for_other_jobs_in_mb` value from its available disk calculation so the rep advertises a more accurate representation of available resources on diego-cells. -- [tracker story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/166801150)
- Secure communication between the route emitter and routing API (mTLS ).-- [tracker story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/167434918)
- Bump `grpc go` to v1.23.0. -- [tracker story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/168144034)

- Include the app's placement constraints to the auctioneer logs when there's a placement failure so it's easier to diagnose the root cause of that placement failure. -- [tracker story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/166365315)
- Update route-emitter to use the `preferred address` from ActualLRPs over the configured mode for advertising instance addresses. -- [tracker story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/166501449)

#### Under Consideration / Coming Up:
- Support [AWS ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) integration. -- [tracker story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/168209772)
- Increase app log max-size limit to prevent large logs exceeding 61440 Bytes from being cropped. -- [tracker story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/168090822)
- Configurable graceful shutdown
- **on-hold depending on outcome from CAPI spike to provide feature support without requiring changes to Diego**
