### Loggregator - Johannes Tuchscherer
* Increased the proposed firehose dperecation window to 6 months
* Supported [firehose-to-syslog](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/firehose-to-syslog) and [firehose-exporter](https://github.com/bosh-prometheus/firehose_exporter) to help move to the new endpoints
* Added additional logging endpoint in CAPI's root endpoint (via [PR](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/pull/128))
* Published a leadership election bosh release (raft based), which is needed to scrape VM level metrics (like Disk IO and Network IO) with the new [system metrics agent](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator-agent-release#system-metrics-agent)
* secured log-cache and loggregator endpoints, so that they only allow TLS connections
