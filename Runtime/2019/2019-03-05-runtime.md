### Diego - Eric Malm

- Finishing up supporting schema version 2 Docker image manifests when staging Docker-image-based apps
- Finishing updating the Diego BBS API messages from protobuf version 2 to version 3
- Revamped the interface to the cloudfoundry/cfhttp package to allow for easier HTTP client configuration
- Starting to explore parameter space for Locket DB client config to reduce its usage of DB connections without affecting Locket API request latency
- Upcoming: still planning to investigate ways to make Diego placement more resilient to unexpectedly high disk usage on cells


### PERSI - Julian Hjortshoj


### Networking - Shubha Anjur Tupil
- Istio track - we have started working on enabling sidecars to be configured by Pilot for c2c. Already support retries and client side load balancing but still exploring scale limitations. 
- Bug fixes and merging PRs from the community for Gorouter and TCP Router


### HAProxy - Geoff Franks


### Loggregator - Johannes Tuchscherer
* Increased the proposed firehose dperecation window to 6 months
* Supported [firehose-to-syslog](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/firehose-to-syslog) and [firehose-exporter](https://github.com/bosh-prometheus/firehose_exporter) to help move to the new endpoints
* Added additional logging endpoint in CAPI's root endpoint (via [PR](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/pull/128))
* Published a leadership election bosh release (raft based), which is needed to scrape VM level metrics (like Disk IO and Network IO) with the new [system metrics agent](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator-agent-release#system-metrics-agent)
* secured log-cache and loggregator endpoints, so that they only allow TLS connections


### Infrastructure - Evan Farrar

#### `bosh-bootloader` (a.k.a `bbl`)


### Release Integration - Josh Collins

#### `cf-deployment`
- Added [`use-operator-provided-router-tls-certificates.yml`](use-operator-provided-router-tls-certificates.yml). Allows an operator to provide their own certificates for the gorouter by providing variables [`router_ssl_pem`](example-vars-files/vars-use-operator-provided-router-tls-certificates.yml).
  - With the advent of the latest release of `bbl (v7+)`, which now uses Network Load Balancers for AWS, users are no longer able to set up Load Balancers with TLS Certificates through bbl, therefore they will need to provide their own certificates during their deployments.

#### `cf-deployment-concourse-tasks`
- Added `open-asgs-for-bosh-instance-group` task - providing uniform approach for setting up ASG's in pipelines (eg: for UAA and CredHub).
- Added optional `instance` param to the `run-errand` task to allow jobs to disambiguate between different copies of the same errand with different configurations.
- Removed `bosh_update_dns_runtime_config()` function from `shared-functions` and removed the function call from the `bosh-deploy` task (uploading runtime-config is handled by BBL as of BBL v6.0.0).

#### `cf-acceptance-tests`
- Continue investigation of frequent but intermittent bosh-lite CATs failures - Other groups run CATs against bosh-lite?

#### `cf-smoke-tests`
- Refactored previous bug fix for leaky orgs/spaces - release v40.0.56


### postgres-release - Valeria Perticara
Bumped [v36](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/postgres-release/releases/tag/v36) which contains an upgrade of PostgreSQL to version [11.2](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/release-11-2.html)

### MySQL - Marco Nicosia
