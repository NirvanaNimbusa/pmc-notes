## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau

- Working toward releasing `v6.46.1` which will include a deprecation notice for `domain`, `hostname`, `route-path` on `cf push`. See the [deprecation notice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EoFiJrL-2-Vhnc5E9GaJ-U6zy0JhSD2dOqX8FFfRHk4/edit) for more information and a call for feedback. 
- Also wrapping up the `cf login` refactor, adding pipeline support for testing client workflows, reviewing metadata pull requests from the CAPI team


**V3 Acceleration Team**

- Wrapping up `routes`, close to GA'ing the resource. All the CLI route-related commands have been converted to use the v3 API
- Completed the rolling deployment mvp on `cf push`. Now `push` has a new flag `--strategy rolling` for users to opt-in to using rolling deployments. 
- started work on `spaces`, converting the final API endpoint and adding CLI support for the v3 API
- Working toward signing the v7 beta CLI and more widely announcing public consumption of the beta
