## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau

- Working toward releasing `v6.46.1` which will include a deprecation notice for `domain`, `hostname`, `route-path` on `cf push`. See the [deprecation notice](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EoFiJrL-2-Vhnc5E9GaJ-U6zy0JhSD2dOqX8FFfRHk4/edit) for more information and a call for feedback. 
- Also wrapping up the `cf login` refactor, adding pipeline support for testing client workflows, reviewing metadata pull requests from the CAPI team


**V3 Acceleration Team**

- Wrapping up `routes`, close to GA'ing the resource. All the CLI route-related commands have been converted to use the v3 API
- Completed the rolling deployment mvp on `cf push`. Now `push` has a new flag `--strategy rolling` for users to opt-in to using rolling deployments. 
- started work on `spaces`, converting the final API endpoint and adding CLI support for the v3 API
- Working toward signing the v7 beta CLI and more widely announcing public consumption of the beta

### PERSI - Julian Hjortshoj


### Networking - Shannon Coen

- istio-release 1.3.0 was cut with enhancements to support for initial service mesh features for app to app communications over the C2C overlay network, plus bumps to the latest version of Istio
- The CF Networking team are now pausing work on istio-release, which has been the BOSH deployed mechanism by which we've integrated service mesh technologies with CFAR for the purpose of delivering outcomes for consumers of CFAR in the problem domains of traffic management, security, and observability. The team has begun exploring how to deliver the same outcomes for CFAR consumers with the assumption that Kubernetes is the container scheduler. We've engaged with the Eirini project team, and are developing a design proposal that will be shared out.
