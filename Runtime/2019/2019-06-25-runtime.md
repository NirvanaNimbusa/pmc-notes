## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau

- working toward CLI release `6.45.1` which will include bug fixes for client credentials where we were not printing the client information in output; `cf push` and fixing an issue with CPU usage when waiting for apps to start; and a minor update to documentation url  for commands that output deprecation warnings
- next up: returning to the `cf login` refactor


**VAT (v7 beta CLI)**
- continuing work on `routes`, supporting CLI commands such as `check-route` and `delete-orphanned-route`
- working on rolling deployments: adds a new `--strategy` flag to `push` so that users can opt into using rolling deployments. Upcoming work includes supporting a `no-wait` flag on `push`, and introducing a new command to cancel a deployment


### CAPI - Zach Robinson

- Finished a SPIKE that explored the feasibility of allowing users to create and delete processes/revisions while allowing routes to be mapped to individual revisions instead of a single app.
- Will be adding the "strategy" concept to deployments to support both rolling and recreate deployment strategy in V3 API
- Sent out [proposal on Deployment States](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10VClD8M1yEptkrlKiQzQ_r3DT-JW9Et9xHCFaQdwKpA/edit) that provides a more granular view of the state of the deployment, specifically around a failing deployment
