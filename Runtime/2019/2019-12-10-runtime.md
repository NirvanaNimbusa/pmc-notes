## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau


### CAPI - Scott Sisil

- Continuing work to migrate capi release components from bosh releases to OCI deployable formats
- Created first successful build with kpack via cloud_controller_ng
- Released CAPI release 1.89 on 12/6


### Services API - Laurel Gray


### UAA - Dan Beneke

- Addressed a memory issue rooted in the session mgmt changes we originally introduced in v74.4.0.  Sessions (held in memory) were not being purged correctly.  The session purge fix was offered in v74.12.0.
- UAA now reports its health to bosh-dns in the same way it reports to route-registrar.  Before v74.11.0, UAA didn't report health to bosh-dns at all, so no corrective actions were possible.

### Permissions (incubating) - Christopher Brown


### Garden - Julz Friedman


### Eirini (incubating) - Julz Friedman


### Garden-Windows - Kartik Lunkad
- Exploring how we can set memory and cpu limits for side-cars with Windows containers. Linux side-cars share the memory limit with the application. Multiple windows containers cannot share the memory and cpu limits.
