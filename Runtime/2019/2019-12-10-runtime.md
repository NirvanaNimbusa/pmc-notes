## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau


### CAPI - Zach Robinson


### Services API - Laurel Gray


### UAA - Dan Beneke

- Addressed a memory issue rooted in the session mgmt changes we originally introduced in v74.4.0.  Sessions (held in memory) were not being purged correctly.  The session purge fix was offered in v74.12.0.
- UAA now reports its health to bosh-dns in the same way it reports to route-registrar.  Before v74.11.0, UAA didn't report health to bosh-dns at all, so no corrective actions were possible.
