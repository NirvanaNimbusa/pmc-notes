### CLI - Abby Chau

### Services API - Laurel Gray


### UAA - Dan Beneke
Released 74.2.0 last week 
   - It includes some changes that SAP contributed and have been running in their platform instance.
      - IP address visability for tighter security control options
      - Logging and bug fixes
   - Improves UAA's ability to connect to it's database upon VM Restart (addressing several instances of reported pain)
   - Addresses two high CVEs
   
We are working to remove UAA's dependency of GoRouter's session affinity
   - Session management has been done per JVM, resulting in a need for session affinity. This requires bespoke routing logic.
   - Externalizing session records will allow horizontal scaling of the UAA without sticky session routing logic.
   - This will allow the UAA to be placed behind a generic load-balancer/router/proxy and complete transactions across multiple UAAs.

Summit Presentation
   - Suggested modularization of current UAA components and a deliberate move to position UAA as an identity proxy vs an identity provider (today it is both)
   - We'll wait for feedback, but didn't receive any intial feedback suggesting this was a highly disruptive or controversial change

### HAProxy - Geoff Franks

[haproxy 9.7.1 was released](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/haproxy-boshrelease/releases/tag/v9.7.1)
#### Fixes

- BPM now whitelists the filepath used for HAProxy's logging device, rather
  than hardcoding /dev/log. If you use a custom logging socket, this tells BPM
  to allow HAProxy to access the root filesystem for it.

#### Acknowledgments

Thanks go to @h0nlg for the PR!
