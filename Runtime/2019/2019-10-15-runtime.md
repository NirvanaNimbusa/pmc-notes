### Diego - Josh Collins
#### Released (or to be released) in Diego-Release v2.39.0:
- Executor will emit "CPU Usage Spike" metric
- Update all Indicator Protocol specs to Indicator Protocol v1.0
- Update route-emitter to use the `preferred address` from ActualLRPs over the configured mode for advertising instance addresses. -- [tracker story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/166501449)

#### Active/Upcoming
- Bump to Golang 1.31.1
- Bug fix: Update rep to stream out the full task result file.
  - When a developer pushes an app that generates a staging result file that is very close to the boundary for max size (either just above or just below), the push hangs intermittently.
- Make timeout value for comms between Rep and BBS configurable
- X-team to update container-networking DNS-based service discovery components to use the new "flattened" ActualLRP API endpoints and associated instance-specific event types instead of ActualLRPGroup-based ones so that they will continue to function after their future removal.

#### Under Consideration / Coming Up:
- Increase app log max-size limit to prevent large logs exceeding 61440 Bytes from being cropped. -- [tracker story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/168090822)
- Configurable graceful shutdown

### PERSI - Julian Hjortshoj


### Networking - Shannon Coen


### HAProxy - Geoff Franks

[haproxy-boshrelease v9.8.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/haproxy-boshrelease/releases/tag/v9.8.0)
#### New Features

- The `hatop` utility has been added to haproxy-boshrelease to assist in haproxy troubleshooting
  http://feurix.org/projects/hatop/ Kudos to @jhunt and the [Genesis Community](https://github.com/genesis-community) for making this possible!
- @Scoobed added support for specifying additional filesystem paths to make available to the HAProxy
  process via BPM's [unrestricted volumes list](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bpm-release/blob/master/docs/config.md#unsafe-schema).
  This is particularly helpful when integrating LUA scripts from other BOSH releases. The
  `ha_proxy.additional_unrestricted_volumes` will allow this, and uses the same syntax as BPM.
