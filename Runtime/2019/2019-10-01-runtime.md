#### Released (or to be released) in Diego-Release v2.38.0:
- Support [AWS ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) integration. -- [tracker story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/168209772)
- When an app placement failure occurs, Auctioneer will include placement constraints and current cell state in the logs so it's easier to diagnose the placement failure. -- [tracker story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/166365315)
- Completed explore of Envoy proxy's CPU load and RAM consumption.  -- [tracker story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/167450587)
  - Found significant decrease in CPU load and RAM consumption when keepalives are enabled (not enabled by default).
  - Made request/recommendation to networking team to enable keepalives by default.
- Will increase the Rep's limit for app staging results from 10k to 20k as a stop-gap measure to mitigate staging failures caused by increased size of staging results due buildpackapplifecycle changes (processes, process_types, and sidecars now added to the result).   -- [tracker story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/168678645)
  - Note: this is a stop-gap measure 'till we decide on a more robust solution for handing larger staging results
- Will resolve an incompatibility with third party network plugins (like NSX-T) whereby plugin erroneously attempts to set up networking for a, recently added, "system only" container created by Diego to check the size of the rootfs. -- [tracker story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/168712225)

#### Currently Active:
- Update route-emitter to use the `preferred address` from ActualLRPs over the configured mode for advertising instance addresses. -- [tracker story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/166501449)

#### Under Consideration / Coming Up:
- Increase app log max-size limit to prevent large logs exceeding 61440 Bytes from being cropped. -- [tracker story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/168090822)
- Configurable graceful shutdown
