- [JZ] Enabling Eirini integration work: https://docs.google.com/document/d/10QzUz3NiVAKDTMyKQxxMfitE-8J01dfvF9RX0lnSOwU/edit


## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau

- we are focused on releasing CLI `6.44.0` which will support client credentials for a set of commands `set-org-role`, `set-space-role`. We also will be updating how we handle client credential secrets in the `config.json` - we will no longer be writing secrets to the `config.json`; the release will also include an update to Golang 1.12.1, and the ability to hide a column for `cf marketplace` (SAPI contributed work)
- we are also continuing rewriting the `cf login` command which will be the last major rewrite we will be doing for commands in the v6 CLI. `cf login` will use the v3 endpoints for `orgs` and `spaces`.
- we are also talking to teams about a Self-Service CLI model

**VAT**
- we are continuing work for converting CC API V2 resource `domains` to V3 and adding support for CLI for domains-related commands
- we are also continuing work for `cf push`, making sure that we have flag parity and server side manifest support for flags (`no-route`)


### CAPI - Zach Robinson


### Services API - Laurel Gray


### Bits-Service (incubating) - Peter Goetz


### UAA - Chao Wang
Completed:
- As a CF operator, I can configure UAA to ignore hostnames in server certificates for TLS connection to database
  - Removes old tls properties “uaadb.tls_enabled” and “uaadb.skip_ssl_validation”
  - Introduces new property “uaadb.tls” with default “enabled” (Valid values for “uaadb.tls” are “enabled,” “enabled_skip_hostname_validation,” “enabled_skip_all_validation” and “disabled”) 
- UAA BOSH Release should stop accepting http traffic from the public
  - Replaces “uaa.port” with “uaa.locahost_http_port” with a default value of 8080 -- this only allows access to the “healthz” endpoint from localhost
  - Requires any component communicating with UAA to configure that connection with HTTPS (may require changing ports and providing UAA’s server cert CA to that component)
  - See change [cf-deployment](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/pull/747/commits/36ee60c629024d454e02f3f965abbbbb33ed6042) for example

Current Progress:
- UAA opt in feature flag for downstream CF component to test removal of implicit wildcard support
- UAA platform operator can audit user password reset events, role change events, and user provisioning events



### Permissions (incubating) - Christopher Brown


### Garden - Julz Friedman

 - Most of team at summit, not much progress
 - CPU Entitlements milestone 1 now shipped, waiting for it to be available in major clouds to ask people to try it out and give feedback
 - ContainerD process support nearing completion
 - Next: containerd filesystem support (upstream grootfs deltas), garden-for-k8s (i.e. externalize, productise and upstream garden value-adds)

### Eirini (incubating) - Julz Friedman

 - All of team at summit
 - Continuing to work towards production readiness
 - We shipped! \o/ Tech preview live on IBM Cloud, SUSE planning to ship SCF with Eirini preview soon

### Garden-Windows - A William Martin

- No significant updates this week.

### Diego - Eric Malm

- Locket instances now expire DB connections gradually by default, with configurable connection lifetime
- Golang upgraded to 1.12.1 in diego-release
- Cell reps on Azure autodetect presence of first-class AZs over dynamic Fault Domains
- Added `GardenHealthCheckFailed` cell rep metric as more specific replacement for `UnhealthyCell` metric
- Added ops file to cf-deployment to disable TLS from the gorouters to apps in preparation for cf-deployment v8 making TLS the default
- Assessing options from initial exploration of how to ensure the Diego file-server's app-lifecycle assets are transferred into containers securely
- Upcoming:
  - Ensure the Diego file-server's app-lifecycle assets are transferred into containers securely (currently over plain HTTP)
  - Still planning to investigate ways to make Diego placement more resilient to unexpectedly high disk usage on cells
  - Exploring options to support longer graceful-shutdown durations for app instances


### PERSI - Julian Hjortshoj

It's been about 2 months since my last "bimothly" report to this forum.  Since
then, we've delivered nfs-volume-release 2.0, including:
- Removing the volume mounter code for the deprecated "nfs-legacy" service. Service instances using nfs-legacy will still work, but will use the same mounter as the newer nfs service.
- Standardizing on CredHub as the backing store for nfsbroker. (This has been supported for some time, but is now the default.)
- Changing the default NFS protocol version from NFS3 to unspecified. This will mean that service instances that don't explicitly specify a version will get the standard NFS kernel version negotiation between client and server, rather than always using NFS 3.

We're currently in the process of fixing a long standing nfs performance in our
UID mapping layer.

dpkg installation issues persist.  We are still prodding the bosh team to try to
get them to have an opinion.

### Networking - Shannon Coen

- Continuing with work to secure communications with Routing API via TLS
- Continuing with work to secure communications between applications on the overlay network using Istio to manage mTLS between sidecars 
- Beginning to think about platform operator user experience for deploying / upgrading Istio and platform ingress routers (Envoy) on Kubernetes


### HAProxy - Geoff Franks


### Loggregator - Johannes Tuchscherer
* Forwarder agent is now default in cf-deployment - this is the first step towards the new loggregator architecture.
* Golang 1.12.4 update - should we downgrade to 1.12.1?
* Pushed a bad loggregator-agent-release (v3.10) that was not able to compile. We pulled this release and will release 3.11 soon
* Log-Cache now successfully uses offline token validation for UAA oauth tokens
* Loggregator Agent and Log Cache use now Prometheus exposition endpoints and a prom scraper to get their metrics into the loggregator pipeline
* More metrics about loggregator and log-cache are included in the indicator-protocol files


### Infrastructure - Preethi Varambally

#### `bosh-bootloader` (a.k.a `bbl`)
 - We cut a new release [v7.6.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-bootloader/releases/tag/v7.6.0). This includes the changes we made to have AWS load balancer no longer allow traffic on 4443, it also includes changes for replacing NAT instance with NAT gateway which resolves the issue where deploying t3 or t2 mediums to specific AZs was failing.


### Release Integration - Josh Collins

#### `cf-deployment`


#### `cf-deployment-concourse-tasks`


#### `cf-acceptance-tests`


#### `cf-smoke-tests`


### postgres-release - Valeria Perticara


### MySQL - Marco Nicosia
