 - We cut a new release [v7.6.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-bootloader/releases/tag/v7.6.0). This includes the changes we made to have AWS load balancer no longer allow traffic on 4443, it also includes changes for replacing NAT instance with NAT gateway which resolves the issue where deploying t3 or t2 mediums to specific AZs was failing.
