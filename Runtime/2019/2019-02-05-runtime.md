## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau

- working on login integration tests and the team is currently deciding whether a `login` refactor is required in order to work on bug fixes and feature requests (and also whether it is still of value given VAT's initiative. In order to come to a consensus, the team plans on spiking on implementing client credentials in the legacy code, and for MFA in the new refactored V2 code base. 
- working toward CLI `v6.43.0`, which will include bug fixes and SAPI is also contributing a the multiple service feature for the release

**VAT**

- working on server side manifest to support multiple apps; we are cross team pairing with CAPI on this work
- completed work for `buildpacks` related commands
- working on `push` flag parity, implementing the remaining flags




### CAPI - Zach Robinson


### Services API - Matthew McNeeney


### Bits-Service (incubating) - Peter Goetz


### UAA - Sree Tummidi


### Permissions (incubating) - Christopher Brown


### Garden - Julz Friedman


### Eirini (incubating) - Julz Friedman


### Garden-Windows - A William Martin


### Diego - Eric Malm

- Confirmed that CAPI image-layer path specifications work for Windows apps as well as Linux ones
- Configured the BBS always to generate Suspect ActualLRPs in response to cells failing to maintain their registrations
- Updated Golang to v1.11.5 in diego-release
- Upcoming: still plannig to investigate ways to make Diego placement more resilient to unexpectedly high disk usage on cells


### PERSI - Julian Hjortshoj

- We are currently pushing to complete nfs-volume-release v2.0 which will consist of:
  * Removing the volume mounter code for the deprecated `nfs-legacy` service.
    Service instances using `nfs-legacy` will still work after this change, but
    will use the same mounter as the newer `nfs` service.
  * Standardizing on CredHub as the backing store for nfsbroker.  (This has been
    supported for some time, but we will make it the default in cf-d and other
    places.)
  * Changing the default NFS protocol version from NFS3 to unspecified.  This
    will mean that service instances that don't explicitly specify a version
    will get the standard NFS kernel version negotiation between client and
    server, rather than always using NFS 3.
- We've recently heard from a couple customers that the `dpkg` install in our
  pre-start script is conflicting with similar installs in pre-start scripts for
  add-on jobs.  Bosh doesn't seem to have a good answer for this right now, so
  if you're a release author using `dpkg` to install things, you may hit similar
  issues.

### Routing - Shannon Coen


### Container Networking - Jonathan Sirlin


### HAProxy - Geoff Franks


### Loggregator - Johannes Tuchscherer

Past two weeks:
* started work on a log-stream CF cli plugin to have a reference implementation of a RLP consumer (to deprecate the firehose)
* sent out proposal for deprecation of the /containermetrics endpoint on the trafficcontroller
* submited PRs into CF-F for all the recent work on the new syslog-agent and system-metrics-agent
* fixed gnarly bug in log-cache's auth logic that prevented users with more than 50 apps to access log-cache
* Lots of little bug fixes

Planed for this week:
* go 1.11.5 update

### Infrastructure - Evan Farrar

#### `bosh-bootloader` (a.k.a `bbl`)


### Release Integration - Josh Collins

#### `cf-deployment`
- [cf-deployment v7.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/releases/tag/v7.0.0) published
  - PXC default DB
  - cflinuxfs3 default stack

- Coming soon:
  - change the instance group deployment order so all logging instance groups are deployed in sequence
  - change the `update/serial` strategy for `cf-smoke-tests` instance group from `true` to `false`.

#### `cf-deployment-concourse-tasks`
- bosh-upload-stemcells task functionality integrated into bosh-deploy to simplify and reduce configuration redundancy


#### `cf-acceptance-tests`
- promoted zero downtime app deployment CAT from `capi-experimental` in preparation to inline the `cc_deployment_updater` process into `cf-deployment.yml`

- Coming soon:
  - update tests which require feature flags to set those feature flags within,  and as part of, the test rather than requiring those flags to be set beforehand and outside of the test via the cf-d-ct  `set-feature-flags` task (tests to be updated: `include_docker`, `include_tasks`, `include_service_instance_sharing`).
  - migrate CATs to V3


#### `cf-smoke-tests`
- Coming soon:
  - add error descriptions to each matcher to make it easier to isolate test failures when they occur.


### postgres-release - Valeria Perticara


### MySQL - Marco Nicosia
