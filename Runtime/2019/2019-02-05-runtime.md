Past two weeks:
* started work on a log-stream CF cli plugin to have a reference implementation of a RLP consumer (to deprecate the firehose)
* sent out proposal for deprecation of the /containermetrics endpoint on the trafficcontroller
* submited PRs into CF-F for all the recent work on the new syslog-agent and system-metrics-agent
* fixed gnarly bug in log-cache's auth logic that prevented users with more than 50 apps to access log-cache
* Lots of little bug fixes

Planed for this week:
* go 1.11.5 update

### Infrastructure - Evan Farrar

#### `bosh-bootloader` (a.k.a `bbl`)


### Release Integration - Josh Collins

#### `cf-deployment`
- [cf-deployment v7.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/releases/tag/v7.0.0) published
  - PXC default DB
  - cflinuxfs3 default stack

- Coming soon:
  - change the instance group deployment order so all logging instance groups are deployed in sequence
  - change the `update/serial` strategy for `cf-smoke-tests` instance group from `true` to `false`.

#### `cf-deployment-concourse-tasks`
- bosh-upload-stemcells task functionality integrated into bosh-deploy to simplify and reduce configuration redundancy


#### `cf-acceptance-tests`
- promoted zero downtime app deployment CAT from `capi-experimental` in preparation to inline the `cc_deployment_updater` process into `cf-deployment.yml`

- Coming soon:
  - update tests which require feature flags to set those feature flags within,  and as part of, the test rather than requiring those flags to be set beforehand and outside of the test via the cf-d-ct  `set-feature-flags` task (tests to be updated: `include_docker`, `include_tasks`, `include_service_instance_sharing`).
  - migrate CATs to V3


#### `cf-smoke-tests`
- Coming soon:
  - add error descriptions to each matcher to make it easier to isolate test failures when they occur.


### postgres-release - Valeria Perticara


### MySQL - Marco Nicosia
