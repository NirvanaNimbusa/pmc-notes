## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau

- continuing work on refactoring the cf login command
- working on testing the client credential workflows in our pipelines
- reviewing metadata pull requests from the CAPI team


**VAT**

- continuing routes related work
- finishing cf push work/bugs
- signing the v7 beta binaries/installers
- finishing the rolling deployments feature for the CLI


### CAPI - Scott Sisil

- Can now specify memory allocation for a sidecar.  Need to do this for java apps so java buildpack does not claim all the available memory in the container
- We have deprecated the `state` field on deployments in favor of `status`. The `status` will contain more detailed description on the state of the deployment versus the previous `state` field.


### Services API - Laurel Gray


### Bits-Service (incubating) - Peter Goetz


### UAA - Chao Wang

- Shipped [UAA v73.7.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/uaa-release/releases/tag/v73.7.0)
  - Synchronized both UAA standalone Java program release and UAA bosh release to use the same semantic version
  - Reverted the unexpected backward incompatible change introduced in Spring Security 5 in v73.4.0: 
    - The DelegatingPasswordEncoder change prefixed hashed passwords in the database with {bcrypt} which caused older version of UAA not understand the hashed passwords during rolling upgrade deployment.

### Permissions (incubating) - Christopher Brown


### Garden - Julz Friedman

- Succesful spike validating next phase of CPU Entitlements work (we are able to implement our desired throttling semantics)
- Various improvements to our `dontpanic` debugging tool to improve our ability to get actionable debug info for low-level container issues that are difficult to reproduce outside of production environments
- Released initial cpu entitlements plugin (no throttling, just information about current usage against entitlement), now working on documented and releasing it to get feedback from users and operators
- Closing in on end of "ContainerD for Processes" track
  - As this track completes we hope to switch our attention towards pushing more and more of the deltas between Garden and other container tools (multitenant-safe disk quotas, rootless, user namespaces, cpu entitlements) upstream to make it available in a consumable way in the Kubernetes/Eirini ecosystem

### Eirini (incubating) - Julz Friedman

- Released 0.14.0 with various stability and especially security improvements (on track for "Ready for Production Beta" milestone line)
- Released initial scale testing results and recommended/minimum requirements
- Decided to make built-in (non-diego) staging the default, this will cause a couple of CATs regressions, especially around buildpack caching: for users who care about this diego staging will still be supported for now
- Incepted on next track of work: enabling migration from diego (side-by-side running eirini+diego)

### Garden-Windows - A William Martin


### Diego - Josh Collins
#### Recently Released/Executed:
- [diego-release v2.35.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release/releases/tag/v2.35.0)
- Provide secure-file-server url to capi via bosh link and update capi to generate https urls to file-server assets when the secure-file-server is enabled, Story URL: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/165913951
- Generate a more accurate/useful error message if/when the TLS handshake between BBS and Locket fails due to cert misconfiguration or expiry, Story URL: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/166962632
- Update `vizzini` errand with a preloaded rootfs so folks running the test suite against environments with different configurations do not need to change the code in diego-release to be compatible, Story URL: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/165473242)
- Worked with the Routing team to move the experimental Istio-based routing control plane components (co-pilot) off of the deprecated ActualLRPGroup-based endpoints and client methods onto the flattened ActualLRP endpoints, Story URL: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/158123383
- Cache/Repeat route de-registration messages to assure app routes that are un-mapped from said app are no longer accessible on foundations with routing integrity enabled, even in the case of NATS routing tier instability, Story URL: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/166555852
- Fix a bug causing platform updates to fail against foundations with only one windows-cell, Story URL: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/166654916
- Tag the cell rep's capacity metrics with its availability zone so that operators can easily aggregate CF workload capacity and allocations by AZ, Story URL: https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/161522214.
#### Imminent
- v1 updates to BBS api to support first-class sidecar processes
  - https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/167261854
  - https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/166989522
  - https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/167266353
- Update `route-emitter` and `auctioneer` to provide Indicator Protocal KPI dashboards
  - https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/165699578
  - https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/165551067
- Finish migrating Diego components to use "Flattened" ActualLRP API endpoints rather than the deprecated ActualLRPGroup API endpoints
  - https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/158123381
- Working with Windows team to `inigo` refactor to support testing instance identity support on Windows.
#### Under consideration/coming-up
- accurate resource accounting on diego-cells when in `OCI-mode`
- increasing app log max-size limit
- configurable graceful shutdown

### PERSI - Julian Hjortshoj


### Networking - Shannon Coen

- Very close to cutting istio-release 1.3.0, with support for built-in platform managed container sidecar proxies and app-to-app service mesh capabilities; client-side load balancing, timeouts, and retries.

### HAProxy - Geoff Franks


### Loggregator - Fred Krone


### Infrastructure - Preethi Varambally

#### `bosh-bootloader` (a.k.a `bbl`)


### Release Integration - Sai Yerram

- Pulled v10 release due to an issue in UAA. Soon to release 10.1 with the fix. Highlights of v10
  - Loggregator now exposes metrics via Prometheus endpoints
  - Enable routing integrity by default
  - Restrict log-cache connections through gorouter to TLS only
  - UAA will only accept SSL traffic.
- Upcoming v11 major release
  - BOSH Service Discovery: DNS Aliases to Services
