## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau

No major changes from the previous update. (close to releasing `v6.44.0`, working on rewriting `cf login`, and we plan on returning to labels work)

VAT - we've completed `no-route` with server side manifest for push. Currently still workingly on domains-related commands.


### CAPI - Zach Robinson

- Starting work on post-MVP Sidecar support. Will be focusing on start up / shut down order and allowing users to deploy sidecar code with a buildpack
- Revisions now work (for the most part) with V2 


### Services API - Laurel Gray


### Bits-Service (incubating) - Peter Goetz


### UAA - Sree Tummidi


### Permissions (incubating) - Christopher Brown


### Garden - Julz Friedman

- Work continues on completing move to ContainerD for processes
- Next: containerd snapshotters (moving grootfs upstream), cpu entitlements operator tooling, garden4k8s (making garden features consumable for kubernetes/eirini operators)

### Eirini (incubating) - Julz Friedman

- Native staging deltas fast reducing
- Pods now created in parallel when scaling
- Working on: completing rootfs patch roll-out workflow, support for Kubernetes 1.13

### Garden-Windows - A William Martin

- Still contributing upstream to Envoy for Windows support.
- Investigating using nginx as a proxy to provide TLS btw GoRouter and container until Envoy is ready.
- Path forward on leveraging native support for a graceful shutdown period for Windows AIs.

### Diego - Eric Malm

- Investigating some BBS benchmark test failures, potentially related to Golang 1.12 bump
- Exploring aspects of solutions to make Diego placement more resilient to unexpectedly high disk usage on cells
- Disabled ssh-proxy's HTTP health-check server by default in cf-deployment, as most load-balancers do not need it
- Continuing to convert BBS client components to more recent "flattened" ActualLRP API endpoints
- Upcoming:
  - Ensure the Diego file-server's app-lifecycle assets are transferred into containers securely (currently over plain HTTP)
  - Exploring options to support longer graceful-shutdown durations for app instances
