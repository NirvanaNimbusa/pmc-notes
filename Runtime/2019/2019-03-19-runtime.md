## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau


### CAPI - Zach Robinson


### Services API - Laurel Gray
- Wrapped up 2 iterations of prototyping for a feature that will allow developers to upgrade service instances one at a time (**update one**) 
  - Tested with 10 research participants
  - Defined an MVP
  - Now working through a bit of complexity around the interaction of the platform and the service broker
  - Hope to have this released in the next month
- Synthesizing findings from our 3rd iteration of a solution for **multi-CF deployment support**
  - Have tested with 14 participants (if I'm late to this PMC call, it's because we're still in the middle of an interview)
  - Based on what we have learned so far, we feel we need to pivot and test a new scenaio with users for another iteration
- Released updates to the platform to allow the platform to pass org, space, and service instance to service brokers so these values could be displayed in service-specific dashboards
