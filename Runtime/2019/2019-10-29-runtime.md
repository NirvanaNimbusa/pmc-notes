## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau

- released [`6.47.1`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases) which fixes a regression with `cf login` which was refactored recently
- released [`v7.0.0-beta.26`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v7.0.0-beta.26) which includs support for `labels`, displaying a sidecar in `cf7 app`, adding support for `--origin` for user related commands so that operators can disambiguate which user they want to operate on, and support for rolling deployments for `restart`
- upcoming xtp effort with the Loggregator team to deprecate Traffic Controller on v7
- continuing support for labels on `domains` and `routes`
- continuing work on upgrading the plugins to call [v3/v7](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/tree/master/plugin/v7) instead of the v2/v6 API
- continuing work on VAT to convert resources/CLI commands: `users`, `quotas`, running and staging env vars, `events`



### CAPI - Zach Robinson


### Services API - Laurel Gray


### UAA - Dan Beneke
Significant Release Content within the last month
- 74.2.0 changes UAA source and runtime targets to Java version 11 and begins recommending the /introspect endpoint over the /check_token endpoint.
- 74.3.0 fixes a cf push regression that was introduced with our move to Java 11 AND removes the '/password/score' endpoint
- 74.4.0 introduces new session management capabilities and configurations to manage them.  UAA can now be run in a mode that is no longer dependent on Go Router's session affinity support - moving session management from memory to the configured database.
- 74.5.0 introduces optionality around basic auth uri encoding; allowing a 'compatability mode' for anyone hesistant to take this change as it was introduced in v74.0.0.  When enabled (set to true) basic auth credentials will only be URI decoded when the X-CF-ENCODED-CREDENTIALS header is set to true.

Team focus moving toward getting UAA deployable on k8s and making UAA a Spring Boot application.  Additionally, we continue to add features and fixes to the Go CLI with our upcoming changes to include the addition of group map & unmap commands.
