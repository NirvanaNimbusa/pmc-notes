## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau

- released [`6.47.1`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases) which fixes a regression with `cf login` which was refactored recently
- released [`v7.0.0-beta.26`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v7.0.0-beta.26) which includs support for `labels`, displaying a sidecar in `cf7 app`, adding support for `--origin` for user related commands so that operators can disambiguate which user they want to operate on, and support for rolling deployments for `restart`
- upcoming xtp effort with the Loggregator team to deprecate Traffic Controller on v7
- continuing support for labels on `domains` and `routes`
- continuing work on upgrading the plugins to call [v3/v7](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/tree/master/plugin/v7) instead of the v2/v6 API
- continuing work on VAT to convert resources/CLI commands: `users`, `quotas`, running and staging env vars, `events`
