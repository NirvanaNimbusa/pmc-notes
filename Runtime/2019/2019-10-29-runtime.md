### Diego - Josh Collins
#### Released (or to be released) in Diego-Release v2.40.0:
- Make timeout value for comms between Rep and BBS configurable
- Migrate container-networking DNS-based service discovery components to use the "flattened" ActualLRP API endpoints. (Outside of the istio-release, there are ActualLRPGroup endpoint dependencies and because istio-release is deprecated and no longer being actively developed, Diego team will not work to transition to the new API endpoints)
- Bump to Golang 1.31.1
- Bug fix: Update rep to stream out the full task result file to resolve issue where app push hangs intermittently when result file is very close to max file-size.

#### Active/Upcoming
- Explore how to improve the developer UX around app placement error messages - specifically to facilitate effective comms between app devs and platform engineers
- Explore App Log Problems:
  - Exploring "Noisy Neighbor" problem/solution space
  - Large Log cropping


#### Under Consideration / Coming Up:
- Refining/Finalizing [Diego v3.0](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/epic/show/4354458) scope
- Configurable graceful shutdown
