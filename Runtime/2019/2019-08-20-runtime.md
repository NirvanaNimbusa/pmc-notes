### PERSI - Julian Hjortshoj


### Networking - Shannon Coen


### HAProxy - Geoff Franks

####[v9.7.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/haproxy-boshrelease/releases) is out
##### New Features

- Syslog length and format can now be configured via `ha_proxy.log_max_length` and `ha_proxy.log_format`.
  Defaults remain unchanged at 1024 bytes, and rfc3164.

- HAProxy can now bind to the default interface on both IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously, via the `ha_proxy.v4v6`
  property. When this is set, you must also set the `ha_proxy.binding_ip` to `::` for it to take effect. This
  feature is off by default.


##### Acknowledgements

Thanks go to @cunnie for the IPv6 binding, and @msahihi for the log customization PRs!

####[v9.6.2](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/haproxy-boshrelease/releases) is out
##### New Features

- Via `backend_prefer_local_az`, haproxy can now be configured to prefer sending traffic
  to backend servers in the same BOSH AZ as the haproxy server, to save cross-az traffic.
  This option is currently off by default, but will likely become on by default in a future
  release.

##### Acknowledgments

Thanks @h0nIg for the new feature!
