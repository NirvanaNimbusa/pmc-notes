## PMC Lifecycle Activities


## Discussion

- [EM] Call for vote to approve Jonathan Sirlin as CF Networking Project Lead
- [EM] Using "alpha" and "beta" instead of "experimental" in descriptions of feature or component maturity?

## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau

- working on publishing `v6.42` which will include a C2C feature whereby you can enable or disable C2C networking policies for a specific org and space; it will also include a bug fix for `enable-service-access`
- working on the `login` refactor
- working bug fixes for `cf curl` and supporting a new flag `--fail` for `cf curl`
- we are actively working on reviewing and merging in pull requests from the SAPI team for a upcoming feature (multiple service registration). They are also refactoring service-related commands and working on service-related bug fixes. 

For VAT:

- worked on `push` related stories, adding support for flags, ensuring file upload works. We still need to work on flag parity for `push`, making server side manifests work with `docker`, `path`, resource matching. More information can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZGvq0biCP4azgz-8mbg5pvCpTUGG17J6r3QhMl8hnhM/edit#gid=1627614696) in the CF Push tab. 
- finishing up `buildpacks` related stories for V7 CLI
- we will be working on `push` stories, and building out the `feature-flags` resource next

### CAPI - Zach Robinson


### Services API - Matthew McNeeney

* Working through the feature stories for [`multi-service-registration`](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_OBnFCsL3ru43PEXocsCc3EuGaM0YLHjr0iAoXnakt4)
* Exploring granular upgrades for single-service instance upgrades - waiting for this [OSBAPI pr](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/pull/628) to be merged so we can move forward with implementation 
* Starting to explore backup and restore of service instances
* We're exploring what it would take for us to move services out of the Cloud Controller


### Bits-Service (incubating) - Peter Goetz


### UAA - Sree Tummidi


### Permissions (incubating) - Christopher Brown


### Garden - Julz Friedman

- Current Tracks: 
  - CPU Entitlements: nearing first milestone, works end to end, polishing UX prior to first release for folks to try out as a cli plugin
  - ContainerD: is now default for container create/destroy lifecycle! working on using for process creation/destruction too
  - Rootless Containers: shipped! waiting for feedback but hasn't blown up yet :)
- Next/Planned Tracks:
  - CPU Entitlements milestones 2/3 (reporting of over-entitlement containers, enforcement of entitlements)
  - ContainerD Snapshot Drivers (merging grootfs upstream so we can stop maintaining filesystem stuff and get all the nice community supported filesystem drivers)
  - Rootless + ContainerD: timelines being timelines we now need to rebase the rootless work on top of ContainerD

### Eirini (incubating) - Julz Friedman

- Core CATs Pass!
- Working on non-functional requirements needed for first production beta releases (MVP Milestone 2)
  - Aim to get a first production beta deployed for people to use this quarter ðŸ¤ž
- Spinning up additional pairs in US, will (provisionally) work on pluggability of opi->k8s yml (to allow parallel pairs without blocking on EU team), docs, and end-to-end-TLS/ssh/container-networking (i.e. the highest priority non-core features).


### Garden-Windows - A William Martin

- No update.

### Diego - Eric Malm

- Continuing to work on enabling Linux cells to pass droplets and other download references through to Garden/Grootfs
  - Finished opt-in configuration on cell reps to send droplet as image layer to Garden
  - Working with CAPI to resolve Windows case of CC opt-in usage of image layer specification
- Finishing up more generic specification of container metric tags for DesiredLRPs, to distinguish metrics from v3 apps with several processes or during zero-downtime deploys
- Upcoming: making Diego placement more resilient to unexpectedly high disk usage on cells


### PERSI - Julian Hjortshoj


### Routing - Shubha Anjur Tupil
- In progress - Weighted routing for PWS
- X-team pairing with the container networking team on enabling E-W traffic through envoy sidecars dynamically configured through pilot
- We fixed an [issue](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/161813344) with RWMutex mostly improving the code here, though there isn't a 100% gaurantee this would fix all of these issue, because of the surface area of how many places we use RWMutex. Yet to cut a release with this. 


### Container Networking - Jonathan Sirlin

  - testing with 250 drains per Diego cell - consuming up to 20% CPU


### Infrastructure - Evan Farrar
