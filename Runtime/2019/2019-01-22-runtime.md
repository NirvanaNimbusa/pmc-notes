## Discussion

- [EM] Call for vote to approve Laurel Gray as Services API Project Lead


## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau


### CAPI - Zach Robinson


### Services API - Laurel Gray
- We have been exploring how we might enable an `Independent Services Marketplace` by pulling services out of the Cloud Controller. We're coming to consensus as a team this week (it's complex!), and then we are going to involve our stakeholders (primarily CAPI, CLI) in a broader discussion to share our findings and talk through options.
- We're taking point on creating a basic `generic extensions` experience, which would allow for things like backup and restore of service instances, stopping and starting service instances, etc. We will need to propose a spec change in the OSBAPI group to enable this.

### Bits-Service (incubating) - Peter Goetz

**Released:**
- Support for client side signed URLs (2.19.0)
- Several fixes around GCP, Azure, Openstack Golang SDKs, and  `DELETE /buildpack_cache/entries/` requests (**thanks to feedback from SAP**, 2.20.0 and 2.22.0)
- Support GET requests proxied through Bits-Service (2.21.0)

**In Progress:**
- Several chores to simplify our Concourse pipelines and test envs

**Upcoming**:
- Versioning of docker images

### Diego - Eric Malm

- Added more generic container-metric tags for DesiredLRPs for CC to use to distinguish app processes
- Finished working with CAPI to address Windows cases of image-layer path specifications
- Added log lines and metrics to Locket component to diagnose API request expirations more clearly
- SSH proxy connects to CC's TLS server automatically via its BOSH link
- Upcoming: making Diego placement more resilient to unexpectedly high disk usage on cells


### PERSI - Julian Hjortshoj


### Routing - Shannon Coen


### Container Networking - Jonathan Sirlin


### HAProxy - Geoff Franks

[v9.4.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/haproxy-boshrelease/releases) has been released:
```
# Improvements

- Converted HAProxy to start using BPM
- Updated default manifest to use the xenial stemcell
- The default value for the haproxy `keep-alive` timeout is now 6 seconds, to improve compatibility with
  various HTTP clients.
- The `keepalived` job now provides a link including the VIP that keepalived uses
- Added configurable `ha_proxy.max_connections` and `ha_proxy.max_open_files` properties for controlling
  the number of simultaneous HAProxy connections without creating new boshreleases now.
- Fixed an issue with the `ha_proxy.crt_list` property not properly detecting mutual tls settings unless
  the `verify` key was present on every certificate.

# Fixes

- Bumps HAProxy to v1.8.17 to resolve https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-20103
```
