## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau

**Current priorities:**
- The CLI team is rewriting `cf login` to enable a upcoming feature. The command will be rewritten to use the V3 `orgs` and `spaces` API endpoints. Rewriting will also fix longstanding bugs.
- We are cross team pairing with CAPI on adding labels to resources starting with apps, orgs and spaces. The CLI will support new commands `set-label`, `delete-label`, `labels` on V7 CLI beta. 
- Releasing `6.44.0` which will support using client credentials for `set-org-role` and `set-space-role`; upgrade to Golang 1.12.x. 

**VAT:**
- Completing support for server side manifests for `cf push`
- We started on converting `domains` from V2 to V3.

### HAProxy - Geoff Franks

[v9.5.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/haproxy-boshrelease/releases/tag/v9.5.0)

- `haproxy` now supports a graceful drain on connections (disabled by default).
  To enable it, use `ha_proxy.drain_enable: true`. If haproxy does not complete
  its drain within the `ha_proxy.drain_timeout` perioud (defaults to 30s), it will
  shut off haproxy without waiting for in-flight connections to complete.

  `ha_proxy.drain_frontend_grace_time` can be used to set a delay between shutdown and
  when the frontends stop accepting connections.

Thanks @stefanlay for the new feature!
