## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Released cf CLI 6.34 ([Release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.34.0)):
  - The `v2-push` that was exposed in cf CLI 6.33.0 has become the default `push`
  - `push` now preserves relative **symlinks** in app files
  - Resolved more than 10 GitHub issues.
  - Deprecated app manifest features:
    - `push` no longer supports ["promoted" (global) attributes](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html#minimize-duplication). You can use YAML anchors instead.
    - `push` no longer supports [app manifest inheritance](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html#multi-manifests). Preparing a proposal on value substitution as an alternative to inheritance.
    - `push` no longer supports app manifest route declarations using any of `host`, `hosts`, `domain`, `domains` or `no-hostname` attributes. You can use `route` attributes instead.
- Published [blog post](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/blog/coming-changes-app-manifest-simplification/) describing app manifest deprecations and alternative features. Shared with cf-dev email list.  
- Started acceptance on shared service commands; expecting to release after CAPI release that supports the relevant APIs
- Started investigation on how we'll make "v3" app commands the default; planning to detect the user's CC version and execute commands as v2 or v3 as appropriate; discussing server side app manifests with CAPI
- Features starting soon:
  - Authentication with client id & secret (no user)
  - TCP port range support for router groups. ([Draft release notes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/143621081))
- Further out:
  - Droplet upload
  - Last login time displayed on `login`

## CF Feature Roadmap Review

See [this proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K7t_p_NT2F7_Dk3eiv7_g1v3rzFE2GLbTQZTY_V-Les/edit#) for background of this section.

Delivered When? | What?
------|------
*Recently Completed* | - Deprecated app manifest features in [cf CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.34.0)
|| - Delivered improved `push` command by making formerly experimental `v2-push` features the default in [cf CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.34.0)
||
*Soon* | **cf-deployment GA:**
|| - Start of 2 month deprecation period for cf-release ([proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KLl4UIQbl92SvYom4fO-LcEoMK1D45KmjA988MwnOR4/edit?usp=sharing))
|| - CF Release Integration team helping community to migrate
|| - CredHub credential generation & rotation for CF components
|| - Service instance sharing
|| - Ensure route integrity via instance-identity credentials (Diego, Routing, Garden)
|| - Garden will stop requiring root privileges, begin clock on ending support for privileged containers
|| - Use layered filesystems instead of streaming-in for droplets (expected to lead to performance improvements especially for use cases involving large droplets)
||
*Next* | - GrootFS (OCI-compliant rootfs downloader)
|| - Droplet upload with cf CLI
|| - Make experimental v3 app commands users' default commands
|| - Sharing service instances across orgs and spaces (Services API)
|| - Zero-downtime app updates (CAPI, Diego)
|| - Deprecation of Consul for management plane service discovery (Infrastructure, RelInt, BOSH)
||
*Future* | - Improve reliability of placing large-footprint app instances with less system capacity (Diego)
||

*Above are plans, not commitments, and may change without notice.*
