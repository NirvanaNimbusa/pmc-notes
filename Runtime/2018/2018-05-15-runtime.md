## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau


### Garden - Julz Friedman


### Garden-Windows - A William Martin


### Diego - Eric Malm

- Continuing to investigate BBS API changes to support maintaining routability of app instances when cells lose presence temporarily
- Declarative healthchecks no longer experimental, now the default in cf-deployment
- Adjusted BOSH DNS alias for the BBS to prevent brief unavailability of BBS during rolling deploys when DNS health-checking is enabled
- Task placement rejections result in task-changed events in the Task event stream
- Reduced volume of route-emitter component logs
- Updated to Golang v1.10.2, but may downgrade to Golang v1.9.6 until [issue #24590](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/24590) is fixed
- lager/chug package now parses new prettier lager log format

|| - Fetching service instances and bindings (Services API)
||
*Soon* | **cf-deployment GA:**
|| - Start of 2 month deprecation period for cf-release ([proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KLl4UIQbl92SvYom4fO-LcEoMK1D45KmjA988MwnOR4/edit?usp=sharing))
|| - CF Release Integration team helping community to migrate

|| - Ensure route integrity via instance-identity credentials (Diego, Routing, Garden)
|| - Garden will stop requiring root privileges, begin clock on ending support for privileged containers
|| - Use layered filesystems instead of streaming-in for droplets (expected to lead to performance improvements especially for use cases involving large droplets)
|| - Async service binding creation and deletion (Services API)
|| - Droplet upload, variable substitution, and BOSH release (CLI)
||
*Next* | - GrootFS (OCI-compliant rootfs downloader)
|| - Server side app manifest (CAPI, CLI)
|| - Zero-downtime app updates (CAPI, Diego)
|| - Deprecation of Consul for management plane service discovery (Infrastructure, RelInt, BOSH)
