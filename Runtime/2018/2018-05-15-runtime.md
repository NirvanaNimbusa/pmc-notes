## Discussion


## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau

- Continuing to pair with CAPI on server side app manifest; started writing stories on the CLI side to integrate the work
- Working on pushing with multiple buildpacks
- Updated to Golang 1.10.2
- Published a [CLI style guide](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/wiki/CF-CLI-Style-Guide) which we hope will inform contributors on best practices when working on pull requests, etc
- Established a CLI minimum supported version [policy](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/wiki/Versioning-Policy#cf-cli-minimum-supported-version) whereby on an annual basis, we will only support the previous year's CF certification (CF Release in January 2017 was v251 (CAPI Release: 1.15.0 (APIs 2.69.0 and 3.4.0). Older CF CLI versions compatible with older CF releases will continue to be available. However, upon the new year, the first CLI release of that year will remove all code pertaining to unsupported releases.


### Garden - Julz Friedman

 - Containerd track going very well, rapidly approaching MVP (containerd for container create/delete, direct runc for processes exec, ready for experimental production testing)
 - Discussions ongoing with bpm around how to support garden's plugin model with bpm (blocking Rootless, for now, since this is required for cf-networking integration)
 - Hopefully fixed the wave of bugs discovered by grootfs becoming the default (awaiting more feedback, but seems like it!). Assuming this proves stable for a while longer we will start thinking about a timeline to EOL garden-shed.
 - Identified and fixed some CVEs around disk quotas when loading docker images (https://www.cloudfoundry.org/blog/cve-2018-1277/)
 - Started discussions with Diego around experiments on what things we can do to make the cpu metrics/sharing story for CF better 

### Garden-Windows - A William Martin


### Diego - Eric Malm

- Continuing to investigate BBS API changes to support maintaining routability of app instances when cells lose presence temporarily
- Declarative healthchecks no longer experimental, now the default in cf-deployment
- Adjusted BOSH DNS alias for the BBS to prevent brief unavailability of BBS during rolling deploys when DNS health-checking is enabled
- Task placement rejections result in task-changed events in the Task event stream
- Reduced volume of route-emitter component logs
- Updated to Golang v1.10.2, but may downgrade to Golang v1.9.6 until [issue #24590](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/24590) is fixed
- lager/chug package now parses new prettier lager log format


### Routing - Shannon Coen


### Infrastructure - Evan Farrar

#### `consul-release`


#### `bosh-bootloader` (a.k.a `bbl`)


### Release Integration - David Sabeti

#### `cf-deployment`


#### `cf-deployment-concourse-tasks`


#### `cf-acceptance-tests`


#### `cf-smoke-tests`


### postgres-release - Valeria Perticara
- Removed deprecated property `databases.databases.[n].run_on_every_startup` and documented how to use hooks to obtain the same result
- Improved serviceability (added timestamps to pre-start; removed traces by default and added option `databases.enable_trace` to enable them)
- Enabling backup/restore through bbr

### HAProxy - Geoff Franks


### MySQL - Marco Nicosia


### Loggregator - Adam Hevenor
- Cut Log Cache 1.1 which includes a Groups AP
- Moved the log-cache components to be co-located with Log Routers (dopplers)
- Readying log-cache for cf-deployment GA
- Working through some bugs with PromQL for use by the Event Producer


### UAA - Sree Tummidi


### CAPI - Zach Robinson
- Working on server side application manifests
- Working on rolling application updates
- Working on integrating perm with cc
- Completed work with routing on istio integraton for routing

### Services API - Matthew McNeeney
- Asynchronous binding support submitted as PR to CAPI
- Still working through asynchronous unbinding support (and edge cases)
- Planning on starting work on [Improving Service Access in Cloud Foundry Application Runtime](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_OBnFCsL3ru43PEXocsCc3EuGaM0YLHjr0iAoXnakt4) proposal soon


### Permissions - Christopher Brown

* Continuing to work with CAPI to integrate Cloud Controller with Perm
* Fixing incompatibilities with pxc-release
* Adding authentication to to Perm RPCs

### PERSI - Julian Hjortshoj


### Container Networking - Usha Ramachandran


### Bits-Service - Simon Moser

- finished up bits-go implementation to feature parity (Bits-service 2.0). Facing some issue appearing on bosh.io still, but code is done
- worked with relInt, PWS and BLuemix to pick up the 2.0 and started troubleshooting issues (e.g. incorrect retry behaviour caused some staging troubles occasionally) 
- started to implement async upload in bits-go for furhter performance optimization

## CF Feature Roadmap Review



Delivered When? | What?
------|------
*Recently Completed* |
|| - Released service instance sharing (CLI and SAPI) and service account authorization (CLI and UAA)
|| - Fetching service instances and bindings (Services API)
||
*Soon* | **cf-deployment GA:**
|| - Start of 2 month deprecation period for cf-release ([proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KLl4UIQbl92SvYom4fO-LcEoMK1D45KmjA988MwnOR4/edit?usp=sharing))
|| - CF Release Integration team helping community to migrate
|| - CredHub credential generation & rotation for CF components
|| - Ensure route integrity via instance-identity credentials (Diego, Routing, Garden)
|| - Garden will stop requiring root privileges, begin clock on ending support for privileged containers
|| - Use layered filesystems instead of streaming-in for droplets (expected to lead to performance improvements especially for use cases involving large droplets)
|| - Async service binding creation and deletion (Services API)
|| - Droplet upload, variable substitution, and BOSH release (CLI)
||
*Next* | - GrootFS (OCI-compliant rootfs downloader)
|| - Server side app manifest (CAPI, CLI)
|| - Zero-downtime app updates (CAPI, Diego)
|| - Deprecation of Consul for management plane service discovery (Infrastructure, RelInt, BOSH)
||
*Future* | - Improve reliability of placing large-footprint app instances with less system capacity (Diego)
||

*Above are plans, not commitments, and may change without notice.*
