## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Jay Badenhope
- Continue cross-team pairing with CAPI on server side app manifest
- CLI work accepted on shared service commands; plan to release this week
- Development work on authentication with client credential delivered, ready for acceptance
- Defined scope for Droplet Upload feature; stories ready to point
- Features starting soon:
   - BOSH release for CF CLI
   - App manifest value substitution
- Further out:
  - Fetch service instance and binding parameters
  - Internationalization
  - TCP port range support for router groups. ([Draft release notes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/143621081))
  - Last login time displayed on `login`


### Garden - Julz Friedman

- Releasing (hopefully tomorrow üôè) garden 1.12
   - Much more transparent GC, no user involvement in normal case, automatically uses the available disk for filesystem layer caches and disk quota, leaving a configurable amount (default 15GB) free for other things like the executor cache
   - Fixes a bug that caused some docker images with opaque whiteouts not to work correctly
   - Fixes Azure repo support
   - Rich error types when requested process binary does not exist (very long standing concourse feature request)
   - Bump Golang 1.10
   - Various other fixes
- Rootless: conversations ongoing with BPM around how to enable garden to run in BPM
   - Hopefully will solve remaining niggles (e.g. in visibility to bind mounts and so on) with rootless mode
- OCI Phase One: working with diego to move feature flag for OCI mode down from CC in to rep so we can enable it per-cell
- Incepted on using Containerd to create/run containers inside garden

### Garden-Windows - A William Martin


### Diego - Eric Malm

- Released Diego v2.0.0 with some breaking changes
  - TLS required on all Diego component APIs
  - Locket is the default lock and cell registration provider
  - Removed support for migrating from etcd
  - Removed many deprecated BOSH properties, component metrics, and BBS API endpoints
- Fixed bug that caused 502 responses from Envoy-proxied apps not listening on localhost
- Cell rep includes LRP and Task instance states in its /state response
- Container creation and destruction messages include cell ID and instance guid
- Updated to Golang 1.10
- Planning modest improvements to readability of lager log messages: exploring ways to modify lager library to support them


### Routing - Shannon Coen


### Infrastructure - Evan Farrar

#### `consul-release`

#### `etcd-release`

#### `bosh-bootloader` (a.k.a `bbl`)


### Release Integration - David Sabeti

#### `cf-release`

#### `cf-deployment`

#### `cf-acceptance-tests`

### postgres-release - Valeria Perticara
- Added hooks. The user can:
  - run custom code before or after PostgreSQL starts or stops
  - run something periodically.
- Added a new process in postgres job that creates roles and databses:
  - Roles and database creation moved away from post-start to address scenario where the postgres client job is co-located with the postgres job

## CF Feature Roadmap Review

See [this proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K7t_p_NT2F7_Dk3eiv7_g1v3rzFE2GLbTQZTY_V-Les/edit#) for background of this section.

Delivered When? | What?
------|------
*Recently Completed* | 
|| - Fetching service instances and bindings (Services API)
||
*Soon* | **cf-deployment GA:**
|| - Service instance sharing across orgs and spaces (complete for Services API, almost complete for CLI)
|| - Start of 2 month deprecation period for cf-release ([proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KLl4UIQbl92SvYom4fO-LcEoMK1D45KmjA988MwnOR4/edit?usp=sharing))
|| - CF Release Integration team helping community to migrate
|| - CredHub credential generation & rotation for CF components
|| - Service account authorization (UAA, CLI)
|| - Ensure route integrity via instance-identity credentials (Diego, Routing, Garden)
|| - Garden will stop requiring root privileges, begin clock on ending support for privileged containers
|| - Use layered filesystems instead of streaming-in for droplets (expected to lead to performance improvements especially for use cases involving large droplets)
|| - Async service binding creation and deletion (Services API)
|| - Droplet upload (CLI)
||
*Next* | - GrootFS (OCI-compliant rootfs downloader)
|| - Server side app manifest (CAPI, CLI)
|| - Zero-downtime app updates (CAPI, Diego)
|| - Deprecation of Consul for management plane service discovery (Infrastructure, RelInt, BOSH)
||
*Future* | - Improve reliability of placing large-footprint app instances with less system capacity (Diego)
||

*Above are plans, not commitments, and may change without notice.*
