Delivered When? | What?
------|------
*Recently Completed* | 
|| - Released service instance sharing (CLI and SAPI) and service account authorization (CLI and UAA)
|| - Fetching service instances and bindings (Services API)

*Soon* | **cf-deployment GA:**

|| - Ensure route integrity via instance-identity credentials (Diego, Routing, Garden)

|| - Droplet upload, variable substitution, and BOSH release (CLI)
||
*Next* | - GrootFS (OCI-compliant rootfs downloader)
