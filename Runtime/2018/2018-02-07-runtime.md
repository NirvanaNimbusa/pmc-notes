## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per


### Garden - Julz Friedman


### Garden-Windows - A William Martin

- Deployed first round of Windows 2016 Diego cells to PWS as testing before GA in cf-deployment. Has already helped with identifying bugs in BOSH DNS and BOSH SSH.
- winc-network can now apply outbound network bandwidths.
- Explored .profile/.profile.d equivalents for BAL
- Starting work on supporting Integrated Windows Authentication for .NET apps. Requires joining Windows cells to an Active Directory domain and x-team collab with BOSH Windows team.
- Declarative healthcheck now runs in a genuine sidecar container on Windows.
- Context Path Routing is now supported for .NET applications. CF context path routing config is passed into the hwc configuration.
- groot-windows can pull, unpack, and cache Docker and OCI images.
- Fixes to BOSH DNS on Windows.

### Diego - Eric Malm

- Wrapping up setup work to prepare for Diego v2.0 release:
	- Consolidating TLS configuration in preparation for components to required TLS
	- Preparing to make Locket the default lock and cell-registration provider
	- Removing deprecated and obsolete properties
- Finished work on new upgrade-compatibility test suite
- Declared instance-identity credentials no longer experimental
- Fixed another case in which the cell rep could hang indefinitely when draining
- `lager` library tagged vith v1.0.0 to be compatible with Golang `dep` tool


### Routing - Shannon Coen


### Infrastructure - Evan Farrar

#### `consul-release`

#### `etcd-release`

#### `bosh-bootloader` (a.k.a `bbl`)


### Release Integration - David Sabeti

#### `cf-release`

#### `cf-deployment`

#### `cf-acceptance-tests`

#### `cf-smoke-tests`

#### `nats-release`


### postgres-release - Valeria Perticara

- Released [v25](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/postgres-release/releases/tag/v25) that upgrades postgres to 9.6.6.
- Released [v26](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/postgres-release/releases/tag/v26) that moves the creation of roles and databases to the post-start script. If an error occurs while creating a database or a database extension or creating/updating a role, the bosh deployment will fail.

## CF Feature Roadmap Review

See [this proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K7t_p_NT2F7_Dk3eiv7_g1v3rzFE2GLbTQZTY_V-Les/edit#) for background of this section.

Delivered When? | What?
------|------
*Recently Completed* | - V3 app features (multi-process, multi-buildpack) exposed in [cf CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.32.0)
|| - Container networking exposed in [cf CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.30.0)
||
*Soon* | **cf-deployment GA:**
|| - Start of 2 month deprecation period for cf-release ([proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KLl4UIQbl92SvYom4fO-LcEoMK1D45KmjA988MwnOR4/edit?usp=sharing))
|| - CF Release Integration team helping community to migrate
|| - CredHub credential generation & rotation for CF components
|| - Service instance sharing
|| - Ensure route integrity via instance-identity credentials (Diego, Routing, Garden)
|| - Garden will stop requiring root privileges, begin clock on ending support for privileged containers
|| - Use layered filesystems instead of streaming-in for droplets (expected to lead to performance improvements especially for use cases involving large droplets)
||
*Next* | - GrootFS (OCI-compliant rootfs downloader)
|| - Droplet upload with cf CLI
|| - Sharing service instances across orgs and spaces (Services API)
|| - Zero-downtime app updates (CAPI, Diego)
|| - Deprecation of Consul for management plane service discovery (Infrastructure, RelInt, BOSH)
||
*Future* | - Improve reliability of placing large-footprint app instances with less system capacity (Diego)
||

*Above are plans, not commitments, and may change without notice.*
