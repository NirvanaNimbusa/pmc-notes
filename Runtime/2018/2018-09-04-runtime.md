[haproxy-boshrelease 9.3.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/haproxy-boshrelease/releases) was released:
```
# New Features
Added support for HAProxy's experimental multi-threading logic.
Previously, this boshrelease used ha_proxy.threads to set the nbproc
value of HAProxy, causing a multi-threaded behavior by spawning multiple
HAProxy processes. In v1.8.x, built-in multi-threading was enabled in an
experimental mode. This can be enabled via ha_proxy.nbthread. Adding multi-
threading works in-conjunction with multi-process HAProxy, or on its own.
To reduce confusion, the ha_proxy.threads property has been deprecated,
but still affects the number of processes run. In the future, ha_proxy.nbproc
should be used. To enable the experimental multi-threading, use ha_proxy.nbthread.

Note: One of the upsides to multi-thread vs multi-process is that the threads
are able to share memory, resulting in the need for only one stats socket/listener.
One of the downsides is that LUA scripts are globally single-threaded, so only one
script will run at a time, ever. HAProxy can still service requests that don't involve
calling LUA code, but multiple calls requiring LUA will be serialized.

# Updates
HAProxy was updated to v1.8.13

# Deprecation Warning!
ha_proxy.threads is hereby deprecated, and will be removed in the next major
version of the boshrelease. It previously referred to the number of HAProxy
processes running, and was going to be confusing with the added thread support.
Please use ha_proxy.nbproc instead.

[haproxy-boshrelease 9.2.1](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/haproxy-boshrelease/releases) was released:
```
A fix to a regression introduced in 9.2.0 which broke the TCP Router backend.

Thanks to eagle-eyed @ljfranklin for catching this!
```
[haproxy-boshrelease 9.2.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/haproxy-boshrelease/releases) was released:
```
# New Features

- The `haproxy` job can now be easily configured to use the CF Routing tier's HTTP-based
  health checks. Specify `ha_proxy.backend_use_http_health = true` to enable it. If custom
  ports or URIs are necessary for HTTP backend health checks, they can be specified via
  `ha_proxy.backend_http_health_port` and `ha_proxy.backend_http_health_uri`. There are similar
  properties available for the `ha_proxy.routed_backends` datastructures via `backend_use_http_health`,
  `backend_http_health_port`, and `backend_http_health_uri` properties on each routed backend
  definition.

  Generic TCP routing was not updated with support for custom HTTP backends. However, when the
  `tcp_router` link is consumed from Cloud Foundry, it now enforces the use of HTTP health checks
  to the TCP router. Previously, only a TCP port check on port 80 was done.

- Added a property to allow lua scripts to be easily loaded into the HA proxy config
  via `ha_proxy.lua_scripts`. This is a list of full paths to the lua script on disk.
  You'll want to provide those with some other boshrelease.

- Added a property for providing arbitrary frontend config to haproxy via `ha_proxy.frontend_config`.
  This applies to all of the haproxy frontends.

- Added a property for providing arbitrary backend config to haproxy backends via the `ha_proxy.backend_config`,
  and `ha_proxy.tcp_backend_config` (the former will be used on default + routed HTTP backends, the latter on
  all tcp-mode backends).

- Added a property for providing arbitrary global config to haproxy via `ha_proxy.global_config`.

- Improved logging to include info related to health check/backend status, and elevate log levels for error messages.

# Fixes

- The default logging endpoint has changed from `127.0.0.1` to `/dev/log`, which resolves issues where `haproxy`
  was deployed on a VM that did not have TCP/UDP listeners enabled in `rsyslog`.

# Acknowledgements

Thanks @teancom for helping out with the features for this release! Many thanks to @macox for the `backend_config`
support!
