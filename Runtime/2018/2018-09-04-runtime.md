## PMC Lifecycle Activities


## Discussion

- [EM] Runtime PMC roadmap? (https://github.com/cloudfoundry/pmc-notes/issues/62)


## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau


### Garden - Julz Friedman


### Eirini (incubating) - Julz Friedman


### Garden-Windows - A William Martin

- Investigated containerd work from Microsoft for Windows containers. Some issues still remain with the image implementation, so no-go for using with CF just yet.
- Envoy for Windows work continues. Several cohorts of unit tests are passing and nearly ready to PR upstream.

### Diego - Eric Malm

- Added new LRP and Task fields to express filesystem assets declaratively
- Continuing to investigate BBS/Locket performance issue with TLS to MySQL
- Added more logging from Locket clients waiting on locks
- Added contributor-facing documentation about new Suspect presence state on ActualLRPs
- Ensuring that new ActualLRP list endpoints are always consistent with ActualLRPGroup endpoints and corresponding events


### Routing - Shannon Coen


### Infrastructure - Evan Farrar

#### `consul-release`


#### `bosh-bootloader` (a.k.a `bbl`)


### Release Integration - Josh Collins

#### `cf-deployment`
- improved diego log-format promoted out of experimental
- support for cflinuxfs3 added via experimental ops file
- Windows 1803 stemcell Added

- cf-d v4.0.0 published
Enabled by default:
  - human readable timestamp in diego logs
  - skip consul cell registrations and skip consul locks
  - secure service credentials
- [cf-d v5.0.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M674BR1gHeKJKJ-lctG-jGDe4oYtRaM0ZGeIfQhB6MQ/edit?usp=sharing) proposed scope will go out for feedback this week
- looking to work with Diego team on small footprint MVP

#### `cf-deployment-concourse-tasks`
- multiple stemcell support in `bosh-upload-stemcell-from-cf-deployment`

#### `cf-acceptance-tests`
- Flake reduction:
  - SSH tests updated to push a single app instance for all tests and scale to two instances for tests that require it.
  - retry will be added to `cf auth` in `cf-test-helpers` (will benefit CATs and Smokes)

#### `cf-smoke-tests`
- Timeout reduction
  - Due to high incidence rate of cf push timeouts for installations with a large number buildpacks we've updated the `cf push` command to include the buildpack name.
    - We're considering making this a configurable option in a future release.


### postgres-release - Valeria Perticara

- Released first story around backup/restore through bbr
- Upgraded PostgreSQL to v9.6.10.
- Simplified PostgreSQL minor upgrade process. We don't deprecate upgrade paths for minor releases anymore. We have documented in the README the [tested upgrade paths](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/postgres-release/blob/master/README.md#upgrading).
- Reworked ci env to support cf-deployment 3.0 requirements.

### HAProxy - Geoff Franks

[haproxy-boshrelease 9.3.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/haproxy-boshrelease/releases) was released:
```
# New Features
Added support for HAProxy's experimental multi-threading logic.
Previously, this boshrelease used ha_proxy.threads to set the nbproc
value of HAProxy, causing a multi-threaded behavior by spawning multiple
HAProxy processes. In v1.8.x, built-in multi-threading was enabled in an
experimental mode. This can be enabled via ha_proxy.nbthread. Adding multi-
threading works in-conjunction with multi-process HAProxy, or on its own.
To reduce confusion, the ha_proxy.threads property has been deprecated,
but still affects the number of processes run. In the future, ha_proxy.nbproc
should be used. To enable the experimental multi-threading, use ha_proxy.nbthread.

Note: One of the upsides to multi-thread vs multi-process is that the threads
are able to share memory, resulting in the need for only one stats socket/listener.
One of the downsides is that LUA scripts are globally single-threaded, so only one
script will run at a time, ever. HAProxy can still service requests that don't involve
calling LUA code, but multiple calls requiring LUA will be serialized.

# Updates
HAProxy was updated to v1.8.13

# Deprecation Warning!
ha_proxy.threads is hereby deprecated, and will be removed in the next major
version of the boshrelease. It previously referred to the number of HAProxy
processes running, and was going to be confusing with the added thread support.
Please use ha_proxy.nbproc instead.
```

[haproxy-boshrelease 9.2.1](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/haproxy-boshrelease/releases) was released:
```
A fix to a regression introduced in 9.2.0 which broke the TCP Router backend.

Thanks to eagle-eyed @ljfranklin for catching this!
```
[haproxy-boshrelease 9.2.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/haproxy-boshrelease/releases) was released:
```
# New Features

- The `haproxy` job can now be easily configured to use the CF Routing tier's HTTP-based
  health checks. Specify `ha_proxy.backend_use_http_health = true` to enable it. If custom
  ports or URIs are necessary for HTTP backend health checks, they can be specified via
  `ha_proxy.backend_http_health_port` and `ha_proxy.backend_http_health_uri`. There are similar
  properties available for the `ha_proxy.routed_backends` datastructures via `backend_use_http_health`,
  `backend_http_health_port`, and `backend_http_health_uri` properties on each routed backend
  definition.

  Generic TCP routing was not updated with support for custom HTTP backends. However, when the
  `tcp_router` link is consumed from Cloud Foundry, it now enforces the use of HTTP health checks
  to the TCP router. Previously, only a TCP port check on port 80 was done.

- Added a property to allow lua scripts to be easily loaded into the HA proxy config
  via `ha_proxy.lua_scripts`. This is a list of full paths to the lua script on disk.
  You'll want to provide those with some other boshrelease.

- Added a property for providing arbitrary frontend config to haproxy via `ha_proxy.frontend_config`.
  This applies to all of the haproxy frontends.

- Added a property for providing arbitrary backend config to haproxy backends via the `ha_proxy.backend_config`,
  and `ha_proxy.tcp_backend_config` (the former will be used on default + routed HTTP backends, the latter on
  all tcp-mode backends).

- Added a property for providing arbitrary global config to haproxy via `ha_proxy.global_config`.

- Improved logging to include info related to health check/backend status, and elevate log levels for error messages.

# Fixes

- The default logging endpoint has changed from `127.0.0.1` to `/dev/log`, which resolves issues where `haproxy`
  was deployed on a VM that did not have TCP/UDP listeners enabled in `rsyslog`.

# Acknowledgements

Thanks @teancom for helping out with the features for this release! Many thanks to @macox for the `backend_config`
support!

### MySQL - Marco Nicosia


### Loggregator - Adam Hevenor


### UAA - Sree Tummidi


### CAPI - Zach Robinson


### Services API - Matthew McNeeney

* Finished off recursive deletion of resources containing asynchronous bindings
* Investigating concerns around how unauthenticated users can see services in the marketplace
* Searching various repos for Services API related issues so that we can start to tackle them
* Potentially soon to be starting work refactoring some CF CLI commands to unblock the multi-service-registration track


### Permissions (incubating) - Christopher Brown


### PERSI - Julian Hjortshoj


### Container Networking - Preethi Varambally
- We began work on adding support to allow configuring destination objects for external services that can be used to define egress policies.
- We investigated a few technical approaches for adding space to space policy enforcement. You can find our research [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hU51wNthb-9hsH2UzXJfY33JvAN_Oq4ClJ1R_e6IqXQ/edit?usp=sharing).
