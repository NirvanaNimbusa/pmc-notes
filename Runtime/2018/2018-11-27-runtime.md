### Garden-Windows - A William Martin

- Working with Diego and Buildpacks on introducing a "windows" stack to replace "windows2016" as we work on Windows Server 2019 support.

### Diego - Eric Malm

- Windows cell reps can now experimentally run container Envoy proxies
- Continuing to work on enabling Linux cells to pass droplets and other download references through to Garden/Grootfs
  - Cell reps emit logs and metrics with the time duration to download assets and create container
  - Working on opt-in configuration in CC to set image layers on apps' DesiredLRPs
- Upcoming: working with CAPI to augment container metrics with CC v3 process identifiers
- Upcoming: making Diego placement more resilient to unexpectedly high disk usage on cells


### PERSI - Julian Hjortshoj

- CSI 1.0 is [released](https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/releases/tag/v1.0.0) and supported as of [diego v2.23.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release/releases/tag/v2.23.0)

### Routing - Shubha Anjur Tupil

- Scaled up to 13,000 routes. Still working on getting to 20,000
- Cut [release-0.183.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/routing-release/releases/tag/0.183.0)


### Container Networking - Preethi Varambally/Jonathan Sirlin
- We added a bosh property to allow operators to use Container to container networking without creating network policies.
- We are working on adding CLI support for configuring C2C policies across spaces. This is only available via APIs currently.
- We are working on Istio integration to support ingress traffic from the istio-router and between containers via Envoy side car. 
- We are working on adding features such as staging/running support, default policies, traffic logging etc into the new dynamic egress policy configuration to achieve parity with ASGs.
- We are continuing to explore adding capability for C2C policy enforcement through app manifest and plan to incept on it next week.


### HAProxy - Geoff Franks


### Loggregator - Johannes Tuchscherer
- Spiked Telegraf to be used for agent based syslog forwarding - found that it is too CPU heavy
- Added the expvar-forwarder process on all VMs to get metrics of the expvar endpoints into metron
- Cut final releases for all loggregator release - most of them containing just little fixes

### Infrastructure - Evan Farrar

#### `bosh-bootloader` (a.k.a `bbl`)
- Still completing bbl 7.0, which includes minor breaking changes in vSphere (flag name change) and a recreation of load balancers in AWS


### Release Integration - Josh Collins

#### `cf-deployment`


#### `cf-deployment-concourse-tasks`
- added `--debug` param to the `bbl-up` task optionally allow developers to save debug output to a log file rather than bbl-up.txt so the debug info is persisted beyond the life of the concourse container. 


#### `cf-acceptance-tests`


#### `cf-smoke-tests`


### postgres-release - Valeria Perticara
- Released [v32](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/postgres-release/releases/tag/v32) that upgrades PostgreSQL to version 11.1.
