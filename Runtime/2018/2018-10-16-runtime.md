## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau


### CAPI - Zach Robinson


### Services API - Matthew McNeeney

* CLI v6 refactors (`cf marketplace`, `cf enable-service-access`) to unblock [`multi-service-registration`](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_OBnFCsL3ru43PEXocsCc3EuGaM0YLHjr0iAoXnakt4/edit) work
* Started designing the services endpoints for CAPI v3 with the aim of starting work on the transition as soon as possible! 
* Been tackling quite a few CAPI and CLI community issues

### Bits-Service (incubating) - Peter Goetz


### UAA - Chao Wang
- Released v4.21.0
	• Fixed refresh token grant to not specify response_type for id_token
	• Fixed authorization code grant to not specify response_type for id_token
	• Fixed not honor Accept: application/json when defaultIdentityProvider is set
- Use MySQL DNS instead of IP for UAADB address
- Fixed 'cty' header bug for OIDC


### Permissions (incubating) - Christopher Brown


### Garden - Julz Friedman

 - We will never ship BPM+rootless (or maybe we just did?! But we probably didn't)
   - Spiking a "Plan B" what-would-it-look-like-if we did rootless *without* BPM
   - But also "Plan A" may now be ready, unless it blows up again :'(
 - ContainerD transition going very well, running on most of PWS without problems, moving remaining "direct runC" things over
   - Now that Windows supports ContainerD we may be able to get rid of our direct runC wrapper sooner rather than later \o/
   - We still have tech debt around "groot" vs "grootfs" which we need to resolve by getting to ContainerD snapshot drivers asap
 - CPU track moving forward nicely
   - next up: an experimental cli plugin for the new "entitlement" metric we've added + operator configurability of memory->entitlement mapping (which will take us to our "MVP" milestone)
 - Various bug fixes on bpm support (see above), xenial support

### Eirini (incubating) - Julz Friedman

 - End to end CF push (including for-fun staging implementation using 'packs') working, with logs!
 - 75%-ish core-CATs working, remaining things mainly around logging/metrics (we only have Oratos, not full Loggregator)
 - Persi PR to enable persistence
 - Hope to hit 100% of CATs soon, then get ready to ship a ready-to-kick-the-tires alpha
   - Collecting feedback for prioritisation of post-milestone-1 things outside of core CATs (e.g. container networking etc)
 - For kubernetes users who don't know bosh and want to try CF: 2 helm installs given an existing Kube cluster

### Garden-Windows - A William Martin


### Diego - Eric Malm

- Fixed deadlock in the cell rep that could cause a long-running container creation to block others
- Finished initial work in the BBS on new ActualLRP list APIs, related to maintaining routability to “suspect” app instances on flaky cells
- BBS reports periodic metrics about suspect app instances
- Working with Garden to transmit better CPU usage metrics for containers
- Continuing to work on making the Linux Diego cells work with rootless Garden running in BPM
- Adding DB usage metrics to the BBS
- Exploring options to make CF SSH work with mTLS-authenticated container ingress


### PERSI - Julian Hjortshoj

- Fixed a number of issues relating to mounting and unmounting of busy or unreachable volumes in nfs-volume-release
- Added support for SMB volume mounts to cf-d, and created a new simple smbbroker to manage existing mounts (rather than azurefilebroker)
- Added support for credhub as a broker backing store so that we don't have to support all the flavors of SQL database and we can store secrets

#### Coming soon
- persistence smoke tests in CATS
- volume services support for Eirini
- CSI 1.0

### Routing - Shannon Coen


### Container Networking - Preethi Varambally/Jonathan Sirlin
- We shipped the experimental dynamic egress policy configuration feature in CF Networking Release v2.17.0 
- We began work on Istio integration to support container to container traffic via Envoy side car.
- We are continuing to explore adding capability for C2C policy enforcement through app manifest.
