## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau

* Working on Service Discovery feature for the C2C team
* Working on a feature to allow an app operator to assign a stack to a buildpack that has not stack association
* Updating to Golang 1.11
* Refactored `create-shared-domain` and `domains` (requires acceptance to complete) to prepare for the SD feature



### CAPI - Zach Robinson


### Services API - Matthew McNeeney
* Working on API stories for [multi-service-registration](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/epic/show/3979252) epic
* Started work on first V3 API endpoint (creating service brokers)
* Defined our [process](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/161808688) for contributing to the V3 work


### Bits-Service (incubating) - Peter Goetz

- Released Bits-Service 2.13.0 which fixes GCP performance issues
- Released Bits-Service 2.14.0 which introduces ShA256+HMAC for signed URLs
- Implemented OCI image registry functionality for Eirini. Still on a feature branch. Currently working on integrating it with Eirini.
- Released bits-service-client 3.3.0 which fixes a very old, but unknown bug, where it doesn't delete old unused buildpacks. Also now avoids unnecessary calls to get signed URLs.
- Currently implementing client side signed URLs.

### UAA - Chao Wang
- JWT header includes parameter cty with null value
- Dependencies upgrades

### Permissions (incubating) - Christopher Brown


### Garden - Julz Friedman

 - Shipped Rootless!
   - Can't wait to find out how it breaks next
   - "I know not all that may be coming, but be it what it will, I'll go to it laughing.‚Äù -- Herman Melville, Moby Dick
 - PR-ed cf-deployment to make ContainerD mode the default when not rootless
   - Currently used for container create/destroy, working to transition process exec over too
 - Chasing down some regressions with latest Xenial kernels so not much progress on CPU Entitlements
 - Tried to mitigate performance regressions in non-OCI mode by finding performance improvements elsewhere, but we're just so fast!
   - Going to spike moving over to ContainerD for metrics since that should remove one exec per container in BulkMetrics

### Eirini (incubating) - Julz Friedman

 - 53/67 "Core" CATs Passing
   - Remaining 14 CATs all loggregator-related, we believe 3 stories left to fix them
 - Container metrics now available in firehose!
 - Bits Service registry endpoint landing this week so we will have a proper blobstore-backed registry
 - Sticky Routes working, now using essentially a GorouterIngressController to sync IPs with gorouter rather than a Service
 - Will next start working on the "Default" and optional CATs suites
   - Deltas between Default and Core: Docker push, Tasks, Terminate and restart individual instances, Security Groups (convert to policies), SSH
   - Optional Suites likely to be prioritised soon: c2c, instance identity/route integrity
   - Feedback on prioritisation of the above here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ElEm9w3X1CYV3a02vOJwH3unORjnvNVF_XrITyr6rek/edit#

### Garden-Windows - A William Martin


### Diego - Eric Malm

- CF SSH now compatible with mTLS-authenticated container ingress by connecting through Envoy proxy when possible
- Linux cell reps can configure container Envoy proxies to get additional configuration from Istio Pilot
- Fixed a minor placement issue when cells allocate additional memory for the container Envoy proxies
- Enabling container Envoy proxies on Linux cells no longer considered experimental
- The BBS and rep components truncate long strings in lager log-line data at 640 characters by default
- Working with Garden-Windows to enable alpha use of container Envoy proxies on Windows cells
- Working on enabling Linux cells to pass droplets and other download references through to Garden/Grootfs
- Upcoming: making Diego placement more resilient to unexpectedly high disk usage on cells


### PERSI - Julian Hjortshoj


### Routing - Shannon Coen


### Container Networking - Preethi Varambally


### HAProxy - Geoff Franks


### Loggregator - Johannes Tuchscherer

- Continue working on the agent-based syslog drain approach
- Investigating the use of Telegraf as an agent on all VMs for logs and metrics transport
- Released Log-Cache CLI plugin v2.0
- Investigate support for regex in the PromQL endpoint of log-cache
- Built safegurads into Log-Cache to not DDOS CAPI or UAA


### Infrastructure - Evan Farrar

#### `bosh-bootloader` (a.k.a `bbl`)
- BBL v7.0 will include Network Load Balancers for AWS and remove the ELBs. Upgrading to v7 will incur downtime in routability to CF until you redeploy gorouter instances to connect them to the new load balancers.

### Release Integration - Josh Collins

#### `cf-deployment`
- Published [cf-d v6.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/releases/tag/v6.0.0)
- Provided environment for Bits Service team to troubleshoot and resolve GCP-specific performance issues
- Moved windows1803 DNS alias to the base manifest so that anyone who wants to enable windows1803 won't have to update all VM's.
- Continuing to convert unit tests to Go and plan to deprecate the bash versions in the near future.

#### `cf-deployment-concourse-tasks`
- Added the `netcat-openbsd` package to the new base container to support bosh ssh into vms (`sh` got dropped when we upgraded the base container to bionic).
- Added parameterized support to set `Keep_Alive` in the `run-errand` task (and support to allow extra params to be added in the future).
- Extracted `git status` to a variable in `shared-functions` to ensure we're testing the output and also exiting when the call fails.



#### `cf-acceptance-tests`
- Added support for "stacks" array in integration config - CATs will validate the stacks you pass in (currently support cflinuxfs2 and cflinuxfs3, will be extended to windows)


#### `cf-smoke-tests`
- Kicked off work to enable running smokes with client credentials


### postgres-release - Valeria Perticara

- Published [postgres-release v31](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/postgres-release/releases/tag/v31).
  - The backup and restore functionality now optionally supports:
    - backup and restore from a separate instance group
    - tls connections
    - authentication using client certificates
- Next to come: major upgrade to PostgreSQL 11.1

### MySQL - Marco Nicosia
