#### `cf-deployment`

#### `cf-deployment-concourse-tasks`
- Added parameterized support to set `Keep_Alive` in the `run-errand` task (and support to allow extra params to be added in the future).
- Extracted `git status` to a variable in `shared-functions` to ensure we're testing the output and also exiting when the call fails.
- When the base container was updated from Trusty to Bionic (as per OSL guidelines), the `nc` package was no longer included.
  - We've added the `netcat-openbsd` package to the new base container to support bosh ssh into vms.


#### `cf-acceptance-tests`


#### `cf-smoke-tests`


### postgres-release - Valeria Perticara

    - authentication using client certificates
- Next to come: major upgrade to PostgreSQL 11.1
