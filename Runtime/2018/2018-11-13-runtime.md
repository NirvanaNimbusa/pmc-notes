## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau


### CAPI - Zach Robinson


### Services API - Matthew McNeeney
* Working on API stories for [multi-service-registration](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/epic/show/3979252) epic
* Started work on first V3 API endpoint (creating service brokers)
* Defined our [process](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/161808688) for contributing to the V3 work


### Bits-Service (incubating) - Peter Goetz

- Released Bits-Service 2.13.0 which fixes GCP performance issues
- Released Bits-Service 2.14.0 which introduces ShA256+HMAC for signed URLs
- Implemented OCI image registry functionality for Eirini. Still on a feature branch.
- Currently implementing client side signed URLs.
- Releases bits-service-client 3.3.0 which fixes a very old, but unknown bug, where it doesn't delete old unused buildpacks. Also now avoids unnecessary calls to get signed URLs.

### UAA - Sree Tummidi


### Permissions (incubating) - Christopher Brown


### Garden - Julz Friedman

 - Shipped Rootless!
   - Can't wait to find out how it breaks next
   - "I know not all that may be coming, but be it what it will, I'll go to it laughing.‚Äù -- Herman Melville, Moby Dick
 - PR-ed cf-deployment to make ContainerD mode the default when not rootless
   - Currently used for container create/destroy, working to transition process exec over too
 - Chasing down some regressions with latest Xenial kernels so not much progress on CPU Entitlements
 - Tried to mitigate performance regressions in non-OCI mode by finding performance improvements elsewhere, but we're just so fast!
   - Going to spike moving over to ContainerD for metrics since that should remove one exec per container in BulkMetrics

### Eirini (incubating) - Julz Friedman

 - 53/67 "Core" CATs Passing
   - Remaining 14 CATs all loggregator-related, we believe 3 stories left to fix them
 - Container metrics now available in firehose!
 - Bits Service registry endpoint landing this week so we will have a proper blobstore-backed registry
 - Sticky Routes working, now using essentially a GorouterIngressController to sync IPs with gorouter rather than a Service
 - Will next start working on the "Default" and optional CATs suites
   - Deltas between Default and Core: Docker push, Tasks, Terminate and restart individual instances, Security Groups (convert to policies), SSH
   - Optional Suites likely to be prioritised soon: c2c, instance identity/route integrity
   - Feedback on prioritisation of the above here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ElEm9w3X1CYV3a02vOJwH3unORjnvNVF_XrITyr6rek/edit#

### Garden-Windows - A William Martin


### Diego - Eric Malm


### PERSI - Julian Hjortshoj


### Routing - Shannon Coen


### Container Networking - Preethi Varambally


### HAProxy - Geoff Franks


### Loggregator - Johannes Tuchscherer


### Infrastructure - Evan Farrar

#### `bosh-bootloader` (a.k.a `bbl`)


### Release Integration - Josh Collins

#### `cf-deployment`
- Published [cf-d v6.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/releases/tag/v6.0.0)
- Provided environment for Bits Service team to troubleshoot and resolve GCP-specific performance issues
- Moved windows1803 DNS alias to the base manifest so that anyone who wants to enable windows1803 won't have to update all VM's.
- Continuing to convert unit tests to Go and plan to switch over in the next couple weeks and deprecate bash

#### `cf-deployment-concourse-tasks`
- Added the `netcat-openbsd` package to the new base container to support bosh ssh into vms (`sh` got dropped when we upgraded the base container to bionic).
- Added parameterized support to set `Keep_Alive` in the `run-errand` task (and support to allow extra params to be added in the future).
- Extracted `git status` to a variable in `shared-functions` to ensure we're testing the output and also exiting when the call fails.



#### `cf-acceptance-tests`
- Added support for "stacks" array in integration config - CATs will validate the stacks you pass in (currently support cflinuxfs2 and cflinuxfs3, will be extended to windows)


#### `cf-smoke-tests`
- Kicked off work to enable running smokes with client credentials


### postgres-release - Valeria Perticara

- Published [postgres-release v31](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/postgres-release/releases/tag/v31).
  - The backup and restore functionality now optionally supports:
    - backup and restore from a separate instance group
    - tls connections
    - authentication using client certificates
- Next to come: major upgrade to PostgreSQL 11.1

### MySQL - Marco Nicosia
