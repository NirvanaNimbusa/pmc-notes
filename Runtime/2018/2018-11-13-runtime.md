#### `bosh-bootloader` (a.k.a `bbl`)


### Release Integration - Josh Collins

#### `cf-deployment`
- Published [cf-d v6.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/releases/tag/v6.0.0)
- Provided environment for Bits Service team to troubleshoot and resolve GCP-specific performance issues
- Moved windows1803 DNS alias to the base manifest so that anyone who wants to enable windows1803 won't have to update all VM's.
- Continuing to convert unit tests to Go and plan to switch over in the next couple weeks and deprecate bash

#### `cf-deployment-concourse-tasks`
- Added the `netcat-openbsd` package to the new base container to support bosh ssh into vms (`sh` got dropped when we upgraded the base container to bionic).
- Added parameterized support to set `Keep_Alive` in the `run-errand` task (and support to allow extra params to be added in the future).
- Extracted `git status` to a variable in `shared-functions` to ensure we're testing the output and also exiting when the call fails.



#### `cf-acceptance-tests`
- Added support for "stacks" array in integration config - CATs will validate the stacks you pass in (currently support cflinuxfs2 and cflinuxfs3, will be extended to windows)


#### `cf-smoke-tests`
- Kicked off work to enable running smokes with client credentials


### postgres-release - Valeria Perticara

- Published [postgres-release v31](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/postgres-release/releases/tag/v31).
  - The backup and restore functionality now optionally supports:
    - backup and restore from a separate instance group
    - tls connections
    - authentication using client certificates
- Next to come: major upgrade to PostgreSQL 11.1

### MySQL - Marco Nicosia
