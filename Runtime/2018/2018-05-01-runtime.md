## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau

- Released [v6.36.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.36.0) - this release includes a droplet upload feature, updated the `bind-service` command which now allows for a `--binding-name` flag which allows you to assign a name to that binding (CAPI provided the PR for this feature.), updated to Golang 1.10.1, now using `DisableKeepAlives` set to true on the client side, to aid with closing connections to CC and UAA 
- Released [v6.36.1](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.36.1) - bug fix for `bind-service` whereby an erroneous error message is returned stating `--name` requires a specific CF API version
- Completed BOSH release for CF CLI
- Completed app manifest variable substitution
- Continue cross-team pairing with CAPI on server side app manifest
- Working on pushing with multiple buildpacks
- Working on internationalization

### Garden - Julz Friedman


### Garden-Windows - A William Martin


### Diego - Eric Malm

- Finished initial work to improve resilience of Task placement to insufficient resources (opt-in for now)
- Finished initial exploration of ways to maintain routability of app instances when cells lose presence temporarily
- Finished estimation of Envoy memory usage relative to concurrent connections
- Relaxed default CF SSH cipher suites slightly to accommodate Java libraries
- CF SSH supports remote tunnels: you can move the cloud back on your laptop!
- Cells with Envoy enabled support creating more than 128 containers
- Investigating report of erratic/impossible app CPU usage metrics


### Routing - Shannon Coen

- Bulk sync between CC and Copilot complete
- Istio transition to Envoy v2 APIs broker the integration with CF; fix in progress
- Golang in NATS-release updated to 1.10
- Test to validate CF integration now blocks merge of PRs to Istio

### Infrastructure - Evan Farrar

#### `consul-release`


#### `bosh-bootloader` (a.k.a `bbl`)


### Release Integration - David Sabeti

#### `cf-deployment`


#### `cf-deployment-concourse-tasks`


#### `cf-acceptance-tests`


#### `cf-smoke-tests`



### postgres-release - Valeria Perticara


### HAProxy - Geoff Franks


### MySQL - Marco Nicosia


### Loggregator - Adam Hevenor


### UAA - Sree Tummidi


### CAPI - Zach Robinson


### Services API - Matthew McNeeney


### Permissions - Christopher Brown

**Done**

* Restarted cross-team pair work with CAPI to give the Cloud Controller a Perm
  make-over.

* Finished the group mapping work so that roles ca nbe inferred from groups.

**Soon**

* Adding a gRPC HTTP gateway so that we can register the Perm service with the
  router.

* Creating a CLI plugin to administer Perm.

### PERSI - Julian Hjortshoj


### Container Networking - Usha Ramachandran


### Bits-Service - Simon Moser


## CF Feature Roadmap Review



Delivered When? | What?
------|------
*Recently Completed* |
|| - Released service instance sharing (CLI and SAPI) and service account authorization (CLI and UAA)
|| - Fetching service instances and bindings (Services API)
||
*Soon* | **cf-deployment GA:**
|| - Start of 2 month deprecation period for cf-release ([proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KLl4UIQbl92SvYom4fO-LcEoMK1D45KmjA988MwnOR4/edit?usp=sharing))
|| - CF Release Integration team helping community to migrate
|| - CredHub credential generation & rotation for CF components
|| - Ensure route integrity via instance-identity credentials (Diego, Routing, Garden)
|| - Garden will stop requiring root privileges, begin clock on ending support for privileged containers
|| - Use layered filesystems instead of streaming-in for droplets (expected to lead to performance improvements especially for use cases involving large droplets)
|| - Async service binding creation and deletion (Services API)
|| - Droplet upload, variable substitution, and BOSH release (CLI)
||
*Next* | - GrootFS (OCI-compliant rootfs downloader)
|| - Server side app manifest (CAPI, CLI)
|| - Zero-downtime app updates (CAPI, Diego)
|| - Deprecation of Consul for management plane service discovery (Infrastructure, RelInt, BOSH)
||
*Future* | - Improve reliability of placing large-footprint app instances with less system capacity (Diego)
||

*Above are plans, not commitments, and may change without notice.*
