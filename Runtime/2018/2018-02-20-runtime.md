## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Jay Badenhope
- Started cross-team pairing with CAPI on server side app manifest
- Resolved blocker on shared service commands with help from SAPI team; CLI work nearly complete
- Continued development work on authentication with client id & secret (no user), with input from UAA
- Features starting soon:
   - Droplet upload
- Further out:
  - BOSH release for CF CLI
  - App manifest value substitution
  - Fetch service instance and binding parameters
  - Internationalization
  - TCP port range support for router groups. ([Draft release notes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/143621081))
  - Last login time displayed on `login`


### Garden - Julz Friedman


### Garden-Windows - A William Martin


### Diego - Eric Malm

- Finished setup work for Diego v2.0 release
- Wrapping up initial set of breaking changes
	- Requiring TLS on all Diego component APIs
	- Making Locket the default lock and cell-registration provider
	- Removing support for migration from etcd to SQL
- Changed cf-deployment to enable instance-identity credentials by default
- Updated to Golang 1.9.4


### Routing - Shannon Coen


### Infrastructure - Evan Farrar

#### `consul-release`

#### `etcd-release`

#### `bosh-bootloader` (a.k.a `bbl`)


### Release Integration - David Sabeti

#### `cf-release`

#### `cf-deployment`

#### `cf-acceptance-tests`

#### `cf-smoke-tests`

#### `nats-release`


### postgres-release - Valeria Perticara
- Adding hooks. The user can provide a script that is run just before/after PostgreSQL is started/stopped

### HAProxy - Geoff Franks


### MySQL - Marco Nicosia


### Loggregator - Adam Hevenor


### UAA - Sree Tummidi

- Support custom URI schemas allowing UAA to be used for custom mobile applications
 - Completed OpenID Connect Session Management with updated UAA Singular that allows for dynamic Single Logon and Single Logout - now npm packaged
- Completed MFA audit events 
- Performance metrics and performance data will be published on CloudFoundry docs in the near future.
- UAA v55 with 4.10.0 with dependency security updates

Next few weeks
- Work on MFA via CLI 
- Work on token claims needed by Kubernetes for UAA 
- Work on SAML identity provider features for SFDC integration
- Work on our ship-it pipeline to automate releases
- Work on achieving OpenID Connect certification


### CAPI - Zach Robinson


### Services API - Matthew McNeeney
- Fetching service instances and bindings work is complete (PRs pending in CAPI). This work allows developers to
fetch the values of configuration parameters they used when creating a service instance or service binding via the CC API.
- We have started work on implementing asynchronous service bindings. This will work similarly to asynchronous service
instance provisioning/updating/deleting.
- We are investigating using oAuth for platform to service broker communication, rather than BasicAuth.


### Permissions - Christopher Brown


### PERSI - Julian Hjortshoj


### Container Networking - Usha Ramachandran


### Bits-Service - Simon Moser


## CF Feature Roadmap Review

See [this proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K7t_p_NT2F7_Dk3eiv7_g1v3rzFE2GLbTQZTY_V-Les/edit#) for background of this section.

Delivered When? | What?
------|------
*Recently Completed* | 
|| - Service instance sharing across orgs and spaces (Services API, CLI)
|| - Fetching service instances and bindings (Services API)
||
*Soon* | **cf-deployment GA:**
|| - Start of 2 month deprecation period for cf-release ([proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KLl4UIQbl92SvYom4fO-LcEoMK1D45KmjA988MwnOR4/edit?usp=sharing))
|| - CF Release Integration team helping community to migrate
|| - CredHub credential generation & rotation for CF components
|| - Service account authorization (UAA, CLI)
|| - Ensure route integrity via instance-identity credentials (Diego, Routing, Garden)
|| - Garden will stop requiring root privileges, begin clock on ending support for privileged containers
|| - Use layered filesystems instead of streaming-in for droplets (expected to lead to performance improvements especially for use cases involving large droplets)
|| - Async service binding creation and deletion (Services API)
||
*Next* | - GrootFS (OCI-compliant rootfs downloader)
|| - Server side app manifest (CAPI, CLI)
|| - Droplet upload with cf CLI
|| - Zero-downtime app updates (CAPI, Diego)
|| - Deprecation of Consul for management plane service discovery (Infrastructure, RelInt, BOSH)
||
*Future* | - Improve reliability of placing large-footprint app instances with less system capacity (Diego)
||

*Above are plans, not commitments, and may change without notice.*
