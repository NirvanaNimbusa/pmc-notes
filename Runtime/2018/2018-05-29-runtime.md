## PMC Lifecycle Activities


## Discussion

- Discuss confirmation of Abby as CLI project lead

## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau

- Releasing `v6.37.0` soon; which will include variable substitution, and other bug fixes
- Next in the backlog is working on the update to stacks, to allow for an association with a buildpack name and a stack name; support for invocation timeout for http health checks
- Further down the pipe, is support for pushing with multiple buildpacks (which is currently blocked on user feedback on app name display)




### Garden - Julz Friedman

 - Paying off some vendoring tech debt
 - Working on bpm support which should allow us to finally get rootless out in to production (needed to get instance credentials to work securely with rootless)
 - Containerd track going very well, closing in on Milestone One (MVP using containerd to create/destroy containers, still using runc to run processes in them)
 - Writing proposal (and gathering early input) for read-only container support, better cpu/mem/io limits

### Eirini - Julz Friedman

 - Completed two initial spikes:
   - new nsync-less integration approach: will work with CAPI to check it looks good and figure out best way to PR it
   - how to get logs out: loggregator to the rescue! looks like [loggregator-k8s-deployment](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/loggregator-k8s-deployment) is exactly what we need
 - Starting "real stories" tomorrow

### Garden-Windows - A William Martin


### Diego - Eric Malm

- Finishing up exploration of BBS API changes to support maintaining routability of app instances when cells lose presence temporarily
- Downgraded to Golang v1.9.6 to avoid [issue #24590](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/24590)
- Cell rep logs into app log stream when starting or failing instance evacuation
- Cell rep destroys app instances on Windows 1803 correctly now
- Locket emits metrics about expired locks and presences periodically
- Some Diego CI environments using PXC MySQL release instead of cf-mysql
- Will explore BBS API changes for more declarative downloads to align with Garden OCI image handling

### Routing - Shannon Coen

- Currently adding support for context paths to our integration with Istio


### Infrastructure - Evan Farrar

#### `consul-release`
- Investigating BPM, currently blocked on allowing other releases to run our healthcheck example
- Upgraded Golang

#### `bosh-bootloader` (a.k.a `bbl`)
- Developed a plan-patch for adding prometheus load balancers


### Release Integration - David Sabeti

#### `cf-deployment`


#### `cf-deployment-concourse-tasks`


#### `cf-acceptance-tests`


#### `cf-smoke-tests`



### postgres-release - Valeria Perticara


### HAProxy - Geoff Franks


### MySQL - Marco Nicosia

- No updates this week!

### Loggregator - Adam Hevenor


### UAA - Sree Tummidi


### CAPI - Zach Robinson


### Services API - Matthew McNeeney

- Finishing work on asynchronous unbinding
- Kicked off work on [Improving Service Access in Cloud Foundry Application Runtime](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_OBnFCsL3ru43PEXocsCc3EuGaM0YLHjr0iAoXnakt4)
- Investigating how to improve platform to service broker security (probably oAuth instead of BasicAuth)


### Permissions - Christopher Brown

* No updates.

### PERSI - Julian Hjortshoj


### Container Networking - Usha Ramachandran

- Working on adding Envoy in the data path. Completed work to have the Istio Router on the overlay
- Next track of work is to support route integrity with Pilot
- The next planned track of work for the team is to tackle operator problems with ASGs. Conducting user research at the moment and will incept in the upcoming weeks. 


### Bits-Service - Simon Moser


## CF Feature Roadmap Review



Delivered When? | What?
------|------
*Recently Completed* |
|| - Released service instance sharing (CLI and SAPI) and service account authorization (CLI and UAA)
|| - Fetching service instances and bindings (Services API)
||
*Soon* | **cf-deployment GA:**
|| - Start of 2 month deprecation period for cf-release ([proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KLl4UIQbl92SvYom4fO-LcEoMK1D45KmjA988MwnOR4/edit?usp=sharing))
|| - CF Release Integration team helping community to migrate
|| - CredHub credential generation & rotation for CF components
|| - Ensure route integrity via instance-identity credentials (Diego, Routing, Garden)
|| - Garden will stop requiring root privileges, begin clock on ending support for privileged containers
|| - Use layered filesystems instead of streaming-in for droplets (expected to lead to performance improvements especially for use cases involving large droplets)
|| - Async service binding creation and deletion (Services API)
|| - Droplet upload, variable substitution, and BOSH release (CLI)
||
*Next* | - GrootFS (OCI-compliant rootfs downloader)
|| - Server side app manifest (CAPI, CLI)
|| - Zero-downtime app updates (CAPI, Diego)
|| - Deprecation of Consul for management plane service discovery (Infrastructure, RelInt, BOSH)
