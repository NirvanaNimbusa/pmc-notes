## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Jay Badenhope
- Released cf CLI 6.34.1 ([Release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.34.1)):
  - Fixed two regressions from 6.34.0 
  - Updated a value in `--random-route`
- Shared and received comments on Value Substitution proposal (as a replacement for deprecated app manifest inheritance)
- Continued acceptance on shared service commands
- Continued investigation on how we'll make "v3" app commands the default; planning to detect the user's CC version and execute commands as v2 or v3 on command-by-command basis (not all at once); partnered with CAPI on a server side app manifest proposal
- Started development work on authentication with client id & secret (no user), with input from UAA
- Features starting soon:
   - Droplet upload
- Further out:
  - Fetch service instance and binding parameters
  - Internationalization
  - TCP port range support for router groups. ([Draft release notes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/143621081))

## CF Feature Roadmap Review

See [this proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K7t_p_NT2F7_Dk3eiv7_g1v3rzFE2GLbTQZTY_V-Les/edit#) for background of this section.

Delivered When? | What?
------|------
*Recently Completed* | - cf-deployment GA'd: cf-release deprecation period ends at end of month ([email](https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/g/cf-dev/message/7641))
||
*Soon* | - CF Release Integration team helping community to migrate
|| - CredHub credential generation & rotation for CF components
|| - Service instance sharing
|| - Ensure route integrity via instance-identity credentials (Diego, Routing, Garden)
|| - Garden will stop requiring root privileges, begin clock on ending support for privileged containers
|| - Use layered filesystems instead of streaming-in for droplets (expected to lead to performance improvements especially for use cases involving large droplets)
||
*Next* | - GrootFS (OCI-compliant rootfs downloader)
|| - Droplet upload with cf CLI
|| - Make experimental v3 app commands users' default commands
|| - Sharing service instances across orgs and spaces (Services API)
|| - Zero-downtime app updates (CAPI, Diego)
|| - Deprecation of Consul for management plane service discovery (Infrastructure, RelInt, BOSH)
||
*Future* | - Improve reliability of placing large-footprint app instances with less system capacity (Diego)
||

*Above are plans, not commitments, and may change without notice.*
