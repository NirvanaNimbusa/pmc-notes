## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Jay Badenhope
- Released cf CLI 6.34.1 ([Release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.34.1)):
  - Fixed two regressions from 6.34.0 
  - Updated a value in `--random-route`
- Shared and received comments on Value Substitution proposal (as a replacement for deprecated app manifest inheritance)
- Continued acceptance on shared service commands
- Continued investigation on how we'll make "v3" app commands the default; planning to detect the user's CC version and execute commands as v2 or v3 on command-by-command basis (not all at once); partnered with CAPI on a server side app manifest proposal
- Started development work on authentication with client id & secret (no user), with input from UAA
- Features starting soon:
   - Droplet upload
- Further out:
  - Fetch service instance and binding parameters
  - Internationalization
  - TCP port range support for router groups. ([Draft release notes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/143621081))
  - Last login time displayed on `login`


### Garden - Julz Friedman

  - Merged groot and garden! New release opts everyone in to groot (with a deprecated ability to opt back in to -shed).
  - Rootless and OCI phase 1 functionally complete, waiting for benchmarks and feedback from real environments
    - Need some way to opt a portion of cells in to OCI phase 2, CC A/B flag?
  - Peas MVP shipped and being used, finishing up remaining pea features (ability to set specific memory/cpu limits for peas)
  - Shipped running-on-windows support and new libgroot to allow easy writing of custom rootfs managers (i.e. for windows)
  - Support for umask-hardened stemcells and xenial stemcells
    - Give us xenial please.
     - pretty please?
  - Dedicating a pair to upstream work (runc, containers/image) when bandwidth allows
  - Succesful spike on a top-level OCI Image endpoint to export droplets as OCI images for "OCI Phase 2" experiments
  - Investigating adding support for optionally integrating with containerd when available on a cell, would allow some nice operator features and integration with CFCR etc.

### Garden-Windows - A William Martin


### Diego - Eric Malm

- Continuing clean-up work to prepare for Diego v2.0 release
- Continuing work on new upgrade-compatibility test suite
- Reduced memory overhead of running Envoy sidecar by improving certificate-rotation procedure
- Fixed nondeterministic bug in `CF_INSTANCE_PORT` assignment


### Routing - Shannon Coen


### Infrastructure - Evan Farrar

#### `consul-release`

#### `etcd-release`

#### `bosh-bootloader` (a.k.a `bbl`)


### Release Integration - David Sabeti

#### `cf-release`

#### `cf-deployment`

#### `cf-acceptance-tests`

#### `cf-smoke-tests`

#### `nats-release`


### postgres-release - Valeria Perticara


### HAProxy - Geoff Franks


### MySQL - Marco Nicosia


### Loggregator - Adam Hevenor


### UAA - Sree Tummidi


### CAPI - Zach Robinson


### Services API - Matthew McNeeney

- Service instance sharing is experimental in the latest CF deployment ([v1.9.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/releases/tag/v1.9.0)). CF CLI build that supports this coming soon.
- Work has begun on allowing developers to fetch the configuration parameters used to configure service instances and service bindings (two new CAPI endpoints). See the associated OSBAPI change [here](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker/pull/333).
- Next up will be supporting asynchronous binding creation. This will be similar to the asynchronous service instance provisioning workflow, except the new "GET" endpoint will be used to fetch `credentials` and other binding information (rather than relying on the `/last_operation` endpoint.


### Permissions - Christopher Brown


### PERSI - Julian Hjortshoj


### Container Networking - Usha Ramachandran


### Bits-Service - Simon Moser


## CF Feature Roadmap Review

See [this proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K7t_p_NT2F7_Dk3eiv7_g1v3rzFE2GLbTQZTY_V-Les/edit#) for background of this section.

Delivered When? | What?
------|------
*Recently Completed* | - cf-deployment GA'd: cf-release deprecation period ends at end of month ([email](https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/g/cf-dev/message/7641))
||
*Soon* | - CF Release Integration team helping community to migrate
|| - CredHub credential generation & rotation for CF components
|| - Sharing service instances across orgs and spaces (awaiting CLI build)
|| - Ensure route integrity via instance-identity credentials (Diego, Routing, Garden)
|| - Garden will stop requiring root privileges, begin clock on ending support for privileged containers
|| - Use layered filesystems instead of streaming-in for droplets (expected to lead to performance improvements especially for use cases involving large droplets)
||
*Next* | - GrootFS (OCI-compliant rootfs downloader)
|| - Droplet upload with cf CLI
|| - Make experimental v3 app commands users' default commands
|| - Fetching service instance and binding configuration parameters (Services API)
|| - Zero-downtime app updates (CAPI, Diego)
|| - Deprecation of Consul for management plane service discovery (Infrastructure, RelInt, BOSH)
||
*Future* | - Improve reliability of placing large-footprint app instances with less system capacity (Diego)
||

*Above are plans, not commitments, and may change without notice.*
