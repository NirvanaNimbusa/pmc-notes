## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau


### Garden - Julz Friedman

 - Containerd! 
   - MVP (Containerd for create/delete, direct runc for everything else) shipped!
   - Milestone 2 (Containerd for create/delete and running processes in created containers) steaming along, nearly complete.
   - Milestone 3 will permit supplying a Containerd socket to Garden, useful in nested environments (e.g. Garden-in-Docker etc) and will look at exposing more metrics using Containerd's metrics API
 - Rootless! 
   - Work continues on supporting running garden inside bpm, which was necessary to integrate rootless with diego's instance certificates feature
   - We are creating a `rpc-shim` network-plugin along with a `rpc-server`, these allow a network-plugin to be invoked over a unix socket which lets garden run in a different (bpm) container from the network-plugin.
 - What's next?
   - As the rootless and containerd tracks both seem likely to wrap up within the next 3ish weeks we're planning to incept on a new track of work around the 16th July
   - Current most-likely options: Containerd Snapshotting (support and use Containerd filesystem drivers), Read-only Containers, Better CPU/Mem/IO Metrics / Sharing (feedback welcome).
   - Also shipped a comparative grid of Garden/CF security vs. other offerings, looking at whether we can expose our defaults in a consumable way outside garden, e.g. via a verification suite or containerd installer so that users of CFAR and CFCR can be sure that the thing running their multitenant data services is as secure as the thing running their multitenant apps.


### Eirini (incubating) - Julz Friedman


### Garden-Windows - A William Martin


### Diego - Eric Malm

- Started API changes to support maintaining routability of app instances when cells lose presence temporarily
- Wrapping up exploration of BBS API changes for more declarative downloads to enable Garden experiments with OCI images
- Switched Diego CI to use Xenial-based stemcells for unit and integration tests and for one BOSH-deployed CF environment
- Added logs to indicate to developers when their app process is killed instead of shut down gracefully
- Added cell ID to CC app crash event payload; submitted PR for CF CLI to display cell and instance IDs in `cf events`
- BBS truncates Task failure or rejection reasons longer than 1 KiB
- Updated to Golang 1.10.3 after certificate-validation issue fixed

## CF Feature Roadmap Review



Delivered When? | What?
------|------
*Recently Completed* |
|| - Released service instance sharing (CLI and SAPI) and service account authorization (CLI and UAA)
|| - Fetching service instances and bindings (Services API)
||
*Soon* | **cf-deployment GA:**
|| - Start of 2 month deprecation period for cf-release ([proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KLl4UIQbl92SvYom4fO-LcEoMK1D45KmjA988MwnOR4/edit?usp=sharing))
|| - CF Release Integration team helping community to migrate
|| - CredHub credential generation & rotation for CF components
|| - Ensure route integrity via instance-identity credentials (Diego, Routing, Garden)
|| - Garden will stop requiring root privileges, begin clock on ending support for privileged containers
|| - Use layered filesystems instead of streaming-in for droplets (expected to lead to performance improvements especially for use cases involving large droplets)
|| - Async service binding creation and deletion (Services API)
|| - Droplet upload, variable substitution, and BOSH release (CLI)
||
*Next* | - GrootFS (OCI-compliant rootfs downloader)
|| - Server side app manifest (CAPI, CLI)
|| - Zero-downtime app updates (CAPI, Diego)
|| - Deprecation of Consul for management plane service discovery (Infrastructure, RelInt, BOSH)
||
*Future* | - Improve reliability of placing large-footprint app instances with less system capacity (Diego)
||

*Above are plans, not commitments, and may change without notice.*
