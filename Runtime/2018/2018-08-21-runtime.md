### HAProxy - Geoff Franks

[haproxy_boshrelease v9.0.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/haproxy-boshrelease/releases) is released:

- `haproxy_boshrelease` now supports the same `X-Forwarded-Client-Cert` behaviors as the
  gorouter. You can set `ha_proxy.forwarded_client_cert` to `always_forward_only`, `forward_only`,
  or `sanitize_set`. However, the default for `haproxy_boshrelease` is `sanitize_set`. This differs
  from previous behaviors.

Thanks to @jgf for supplying this feature!
