## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau


### Garden - Julz Friedman


### Garden-Windows - A William Martin


### Diego - Eric Malm

- Finished exploration of BBS API changes to support maintaining routability of app instances when cells lose presence temporarily, starting track of stories with API changes
- Exploring BBS API changes for more declarative downloads to enable Garden experiments with OCI images
- Cell rep rejects Task instead of failing it when container creation fails, allowing BBS to retry placing it
- Fixing issue with Diego file-server returning stale app-lifecycle assets when releases are pre-compiled
- Validating compatibility of Diego components with Xenial-based stemcells
- Preparing to switch one Diego CI environment to run Garden in rootless mode on Linux Diego cells

## CF Feature Roadmap Review



Delivered When? | What?
------|------
*Recently Completed* |
|| - Released service instance sharing (CLI and SAPI) and service account authorization (CLI and UAA)
|| - Fetching service instances and bindings (Services API)
||
*Soon* | **cf-deployment GA:**
|| - Start of 2 month deprecation period for cf-release ([proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KLl4UIQbl92SvYom4fO-LcEoMK1D45KmjA988MwnOR4/edit?usp=sharing))
|| - CF Release Integration team helping community to migrate
|| - CredHub credential generation & rotation for CF components
|| - Ensure route integrity via instance-identity credentials (Diego, Routing, Garden)
|| - Garden will stop requiring root privileges, begin clock on ending support for privileged containers
|| - Use layered filesystems instead of streaming-in for droplets (expected to lead to performance improvements especially for use cases involving large droplets)
|| - Async service binding creation and deletion (Services API)
|| - Droplet upload, variable substitution, and BOSH release (CLI)
||
*Next* | - GrootFS (OCI-compliant rootfs downloader)
|| - Server side app manifest (CAPI, CLI)
|| - Zero-downtime app updates (CAPI, Diego)
|| - Deprecation of Consul for management plane service discovery (Infrastructure, RelInt, BOSH)
||
*Future* | - Improve reliability of placing large-footprint app instances with less system capacity (Diego)
||
