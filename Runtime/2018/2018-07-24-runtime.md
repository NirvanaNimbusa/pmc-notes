## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau


### Garden - Julz Friedman


### Eirini (incubating) - Julz Friedman


### Garden-Windows - A William Martin


### Diego - Eric Malm

- Finishing initial work on BBS API and LRP convergence changes to support maintaining routability of app instances when cells lose presence temporarily
- Finishing Diego work to allow operators to restrict container ingress only to authenticated clients, building on top of route integrity
- Improved Xenial-stemcell integration by making rep kernel-parameter tuning explicit; will change to be the same for other jobs soon
- Will start work soon on BBS API changes for more declarative downloads, to enable Garden experiments with OCI images


### Routing - Shubha Anjur Tupil 
Istio 
- Close to delivering scaling with 500 routes and 500 apps. Next step is to test with 500 apps and 3000 instances. 
- Working on solutions to limit the number of routes we synch from Diego and CC (to be able to push to PWS before reaching PWS scale without taking down the whole control plane)

TOB 
- BPM routing components (https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1358110/search?q=label%3A%22bpm%22)
