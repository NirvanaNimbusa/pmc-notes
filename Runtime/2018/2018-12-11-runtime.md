## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau

- released CLI [`v6.41`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases) which includes the ability to assign a stack to a buildpack, support for Service Discovery whereby users can now use `cf create-shared-domain` to create an internal route, and we've updated to Golang 1.11.x. The release also includes refactors of commands to prepare for feature work. 
- Currently working on `cf curl` and `cf login` refactors
- The C2C team are submitting pull requests for a upcoming feature for creating network policies between spaces.

- For CLI VAT, we are currently working on updating `cf push`; we have a suite of integration tests which were failing when run against the new v7 `cf push` - we are working on getting the tests to pass again so that we can continue building v7 `cf push`.

### Container Networking - Preethi Varambally/Jonathan Sirlin
- We are continuing to work on adding CLI support for configuring C2C policies across spaces. This is only available via APIs currently.
- We have completed the work for supporting ingress traffic from the istio-router and between containers via Envoy side car.
- We are working on supporting route integrity for container to container traffic.
- We are continuing to build parity with ASG for the new dynamic egress policy system. We are exploring building a translation tool that would convert ASGs into dynamic egress policies for a seamless transition to the new system when we eventually deprecate ASGs.
