## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau


### Garden - Julz Friedman

 - Work begun on new 'CPU Entitlements' (more sane CPU metrics and sharing for CF) epic, first milestone underway
   - Milestone 0 (Underway): Make memory->cpu share mapping easy to understand for operators, by flowing it through 1:1.
   - Milestone 1 (Next):  Expose new cpu metric which is relative to a cpu entitlement rather than host cpu
   - Milestone 2 (Future): Produce operator tooling showing which apps are exceeding their entitlement over a rolling window
   - Milestone 3 (Future): Throttle apps which consistently exceed entitlement such that other apps are favoured when attempting to burst over entitlement
 - Fixed some bugs in BPM support (last blocker before being able to enable rootless experimentally in production)
 - Containerd now on 10% of cells on PWS!
   - Work progressing on Containerd Milestone 2 (Using Containerd for Process creation)


### Eirini (incubating) - Julz Friedman

 - Smoke tests pass!
   - Had to use StatefulSets instead of Deployments so that `INSTANCE_INDEX` works, decided to defer decision to use Deployments (and deprecate `INSTANCE_INDEX`) for later.
 - Struggling to get logcache working again - worked when we spiked it a couple months ago :(
 - Next up: get logcache working again, run the cats(!)

### Garden-Windows - A William Martin


### Diego - Eric Malm

- Finished initial work on BBS API and LRP convergence changes to support maintaining routability of app instances when cells lose presence temporarily, on opt-in basis for now
- Finished work to allow operators to restrict container ingress only to authenticated clients, building on top of route integrity
- Container Envoy proxies get gorouters to reject them during graceful shutdown by presenting invalid certs
- Xenial integration: made kernel-tuning behavior explicit on other Diego jobs
- Adjusted rep directory structure to integrate correctly with garden-runc when both run in BPM
- Documented more details of BBS API endpoint revisioning scheme


### Routing - Shannon Coen

- Integration between CF and istio-release has been tested to scale of 500 routes and 500 apps, in order to deploy to PWS we must support 20,000
- Scaling has been temporarily put down while we add support to CC and Copilot for a weight attribute of route mapping. This will enable app developers to manage the proportion of requests sent to apps mapped to the same route.
- Our community pair is contributing support for the Mesh Configuration Protocol to Istio Pilot, which will enable us to remove our in-process plugin for CF.

### postgres-release - Valeria Perticara


### HAProxy - Geoff Franks
[v8.9.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/haproxy-boshrelease/releases) was released:
```# Improvements + Bug Fixes

- X-Forwarded-Client-Cert header is now added if client certificate is present during mutual tls
  Thanks @jgf for the addition!
- Fixed a path typo for the ttar package. Thanks @ntdt for the fix!
- HTTP health check ports are now configurable, thanks to @lowlatency!
```
### MySQL - Marco Nicosia


### Loggregator - Adam Hevenor


### UAA - Sree Tummidi


### CAPI - Zach Robinson

- Finishing server side application manifests
- Enabling ccdb encryption key rotation
- Encrypting traffic between gorouter and cc
- Working on rolling application updates
- Working on integrating perm with cc

### Services API - Matthew McNeeney

- Async binding and unbinding work is PR'd into CC!
- Some edge cases to finish off, but about to start work on [multi-service registration](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_OBnFCsL3ru43PEXocsCc3EuGaM0YLHjr0iAoXnakt4/edit)


### Permissions (incubating) - Christopher Brown


### PERSI - Julian Hjortshoj


### Container Networking - Preethi Varambally
- We are continuing to work on adding support for dynamic egress policies to address concerns around ASGs needing app restarts to be applied. Egress policy configuration at the app level is completed and we are currently working on supporting space level egress policies.
- We are working towards making Polyglot Service Discovery GA.


### Bits-Service (incubating) - Simon Moser
