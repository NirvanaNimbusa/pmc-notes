## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau


### Garden - Julz Friedman


### Eirini (incubating) - Julz Friedman


### Garden-Windows - A William Martin


### Diego - Eric Malm

- Finished exploration of BBS API changes for more declarative downloads to enable Garden experiments with OCI images, will start that work soon
- Continuing work on BBS API and LRP convergence changes to support maintaining routability of app instances when cells lose presence temporarily
- Diego file server returns ETag header with asset checksum to ensure cells invalidate lifecycle bundles when compiled releases have older dates
- Diego components fail on startup if they cannot connect to their local metron agent
  - Seems to cause Windows components not to start reliably on some IaaSes, currently investigating with the Garden-Windows team
- Fixed a goroutine leak in the rep resulting from some internal refactoring
- Will start work soon to allow operators to restrict container ingress only to authenticated clients, building on top of route integrity


### Routing - Shannon Coen


### Infrastructure - Evan Farrar

#### `consul-release`


#### `bosh-bootloader` (a.k.a `bbl`)


### Release Integration - David Sabeti

#### `cf-deployment`


#### `cf-deployment-concourse-tasks`


#### `cf-acceptance-tests`


#### `cf-smoke-tests`



### postgres-release - Valeria Perticara


### HAProxy - Geoff Franks

8.8.0 is out, based off a PR from @stefanlay, adds additional support for deny ACLs that are more flexible than the internal-only-ciders + internal-sites properties.

### MySQL - Marco Nicosia


### Loggregator - Adam Hevenor


### UAA - Sree Tummidi


### CAPI - Zach Robinson


### Services API - Matthew McNeeney

* Still working on asynchronous bindings (almost done!)


### Permissions (incubating) - Christopher Brown

* No updates from last time.


### PERSI - Julian Hjortshoj


### Container Networking - Usha Ramachandran


### Bits-Service (incubating) - Simon Moser

Release bits-servce 2.6.0 yesterday 

- Expose /app_stash/matches as public endpoint through signed URLs (#153176709)
- Client can specify matched resources when uploading to /packages. /app_stash/bundles is now deprecated (#157920860)
- Introduce experimental support for Alibaba Cloud Storage (#157920860)
- Bad requests (including non-existing endpoints) don't emit any metrics other thanstatus-4xx (#158526741)
- Various improvements on config file input validation

Fixes

- Log low-level errors happening in Go http server as error, not info
- Properly use default value for AWS region when it is not specified (#158658908)
- Remove noisy TLS Handshake error from 127.0.0.1 in log files coming from consul agent health check (#158140121)

## CF Feature Roadmap Review



Delivered When? | What?
------|------
*Recently Completed* |
|| - Released service instance sharing (CLI and SAPI) and service account authorization (CLI and UAA)
|| - Fetching service instances and bindings (Services API)
||
*Soon* | **cf-deployment GA:**
|| - Start of 2 month deprecation period for cf-release ([proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KLl4UIQbl92SvYom4fO-LcEoMK1D45KmjA988MwnOR4/edit?usp=sharing))
|| - CF Release Integration team helping community to migrate
|| - CredHub credential generation & rotation for CF components
|| - Ensure route integrity via instance-identity credentials (Diego, Routing, Garden)
|| - Garden will stop requiring root privileges, begin clock on ending support for privileged containers
|| - Use layered filesystems instead of streaming-in for droplets (expected to lead to performance improvements especially for use cases involving large droplets)
|| - Async service binding creation and deletion (Services API)
|| - Droplet upload, variable substitution, and BOSH release (CLI)
||
*Next* | - GrootFS (OCI-compliant rootfs downloader)
|| - Server side app manifest (CAPI, CLI)
|| - Zero-downtime app updates (CAPI, Diego)
|| - Deprecation of Consul for management plane service discovery (Infrastructure, RelInt, BOSH)
||
*Future* | - Improve reliability of placing large-footprint app instances with less system capacity (Diego)
||

*Above are plans, not commitments, and may change without notice.*
