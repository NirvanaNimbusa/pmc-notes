## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Abby Chau


### CAPI - Zach Robinson


### Services API - Matthew McNeeney


### Bits-Service (incubating) - Peter Goetz


### UAA - Chao Wang
- Released v4.22.0
	- Platform operator can disable an identity zone
	- Platform Operator sees error message when token scope claim fails validation
	- AA should send auth requests with the state parameter for OIDC/OAuth identity providers
	- Update the JVM TTL property to stop caching the DNS records
	- Use MySQL DNS instead of IP for UAADB address

### Permissions (incubating) - Christopher Brown


### Garden - Julz Friedman

 - Rootless/BPM shipped, again
   - We now have a full CF in our CI running a spicy environment to catch problems on this
   - Spiked an alternate approach, but we think we're going to stick with BPM
 - New Entitlement-based CPU metrics now experimentally available on firehose
   - Next step: CLI plugin for users to play with, operator param to set mem->entitlement scaling factor
 - ContainerD continues running solidy in PWS, ready to make this the default and deprecate our built-in runner outside of Windows
   - Work continues to move Process running to ContainerD also, then we will look at snapshot drivers (i.e. folding Grootfs in to upstream ContainerD)
 - Miscellaneous fixes, bumped to go 1.11.1
 - Officially end of lifed garden-shed, story to delete it in-flight(!)
 - Noticed a performance regression in Xenial that only affects non-OCI mode
   - This means the performance differential for OCI mode in Xenial looks to have gone from "nice to have" to "fairly significant"
 - Here is a fancy color-coded overview of our tracks that we're going to try to keep up to date: http://tiny.cc/garden-tracks

### Eirini (incubating) - Julz Friedman

 - Approximately 75% of core CATs, now looking at expanding to default CATs suites
 - Biggest remaining areas: sticky sessions (requires some refactors) and loggregator integration
 - PRs to CAPI merged, yay!
   - Meeting set up with Diego/Capi/Eirini to discuss future OPI thoughts
 - Two helm installs to a CF!

### Garden-Windows - A William Martin

- Working on a way to inject an OCI layer to the rootfs to provide operators' trusted CA certs to Windows trust store.
- Envoy Windows work continues; code is starting to be accepted upstream by core Envoy.
- Blocked on Windows Server 2019 support due to Microsoft not having shipped a container base image.
- Unblocked on supporting SMB mounts from Windows containers.
- Keeping an eye on Microsoft's `runhcs` binary, which is an equivalent to `winc`.
- In a holding pattern for containerD support, but watching Microsoft's contributions closely.

### Diego - Eric Malm

- BBS and Locket support connecting to Google Cloud SQL over TLS by opting out of hostname verification
- Added DB usage metrics to the BBS
- Added an `actual-lrps` command to `cfdot` to list all ActualLRPs in the BBS instead of previous ActualLRPGroup-based commands
- Making CF SSH compatible with mTLS-authenticated container ingress by connecting through Envoy proxy when possible
- Working with Container Networking to get Istio Pilot optionally to configure container Envoy proxies
- Fixing a minor placement issue when cells allocate additional memory for the container Envoy proxies


### PERSI - Julian Hjortshoj


### Routing - Shannon Coen

- Experimental support for weighted routing using istio-release
- Refactoring MCP implementation in Copilot; will return to working toward scale target of 20k shortly.
- Cutting releases of routing-release blocked on inconsistent perf test results

### Container Networking - Preethi Varambally/Jonathan Sirlin
- We are continuing to work on Istio integration to support container to container traffic via Envoy side car.
- We are continuing to explore adding capability for C2C policy enforcement through app manifest.
- We are exploring the option of adding a bosh property to allow operators to use Container to container networking without creating network policies


### HAProxy - Geoff Franks

### Loggregator - Johannes Tuchscherer

- Agent based syslog system is working piece of software, creating large deployment to the new system
- Breaking API change in log-cache 2.0 release (the location of the `/v1/read/` endpoint changed to `/api/v1/read/`
- Log-Cache-Cli plugin updates: new `query` command, UX improvments
- Go 1.11.1 amd GRPC updates


### Infrastructure - Evan Farrar

#### `bosh-bootloader` (a.k.a `bbl`)


### Release Integration - Josh Collins

#### `cf-deployment`
- Set the `policy-server.enable_space_developer_self_service` property to true to allow SpaceDevelopers to set network policies now that container networking is enabled by default.
- Added experimental support for zero downtime deploys (for pushing apps)
- Added experimental support for `create-swap-delete` BOSH deployment vm_strategy
- Have begun converting the cf-deployment unit tests from bash to go
- [cf-d v6.0.0 scope proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LMr2Ik5T_3lY99I6CBE5_1-hRRixBlDPPqKxh-rARR0/edit?usp=sharing) published for community feedback and now finalized.
Relint will kick off work tomorrow and release on Monday November 5th.
  - inline use-cflinuxfs3.yml
  - Change instance group name from windows2016-cell to windows1803-cell
  - Change stemcell alias from windows2016 to windows1803
  - Remove references to azure and replace them with the more generic smb in the `enable-smb-volume-service.yml experimental ops file
  - Delete all ops files deprecated in cf-d v5.0.0


#### `cf-deployment-concourse-tasks`
- Because ubuntu-trusty is on it's way to EOL, and given OSL guidelines, we've updated cfdct to:
  - update golang in our docker images
  - pull the latest bionic image and trigger docker image builds automatically
- Unpin cf-cli release now that the cf app details have been re-added (this unblocks a few CATs stories that were dependent on the latest cf-cli version)


#### `cf-acceptance-tests`
- Fix issue with Windows tests so the 'include_internet_dependent' flag is respected
- Use CF CLI command (rather than curl) to create and delete service bindings

#### `cf-smoke-tests`
- smokes are BPM-ified.
- Windows-only BOSH deployments can now run smokes.
- Add scale and app status timeouts to config and use them consistently


### postgres-release - Valeria Perticara
- Extending backup and restore feature.
  - Added SSL support in backup and restore
  - Working on allowing authentication with certs in backup and restore

### MySQL - Marco Nicosia
