#### `consul-release` ---- SHOULD WE REMOVE THIS FROM ALL TEMPLATES GOING FORWARD?


#### `bosh-bootloader` (a.k.a `bbl`)


### Release Integration - Josh Collins

#### `cf-deployment`
- Set the `policy-server.enable_space_developer_self_service` property to true to allow SpaceDevelopers to set network policies now that container networking is enabled by default.
- Added support to enable PWS to deploy the zero downtime cf push feature
- Have begun converting the cf-deployment unit tests from bash to go
- [cf-d v6.0.0 scope proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LMr2Ik5T_3lY99I6CBE5_1-hRRixBlDPPqKxh-rARR0/edit?usp=sharing) published for community feedback
  - inline use-cflinuxfs3.yml
  - Change instance group name from windows2016-cell to windows1803-cell
  - Change stemcell alias from windows2016 to windows1803
  - Remove references to azure and replace them with the more generic smb in the `enable-smb-volume-service.yml experimental ops file
  - Add experimental support for hot swap bosh deploys


#### `cf-deployment-concourse-tasks`
- Because ubuntu-trusty is on it's way to EOL, and given OSL guidelines, we've updated cfdct to:
  - update golang in our docker images
  - pull the latest bionic image and trigger docker image builds automatically
- Unpin cf-cli release now that the cf app details have been re-added (this unblocks a few CATs stories that were dependent on the latest cf-cli version)


#### `cf-acceptance-tests`
- Fix issue with Windows tests so the 'include_internet_dependent' flag is respected
- Reduce flakiness around service broker healthchecks by calling `v3-set-health-check` - which supports setting a timeout value (set to 10 seconds)
- Use CF CLI command (rather than curl) to create and delete service bindings

#### `cf-smoke-tests`
- Smoke-test errand BPM-ified


### postgres-release - Valeria Perticara


### MySQL - Marco Nicosia
