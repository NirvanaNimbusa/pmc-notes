## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Distributed a survey to gather feedback from the CF community on simplifying the app manifest. Giving people another week to reply. Received over 100 responses so far.
- Released cf CLI 6.33.0 ([Release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.33.0)):
  - Introduces `v2-push`, which is a refactor of `push`. Try it out and give us your feedback!
    We will offer both versions of push side-by-side for limited time for community to try the new implementation and report any issues.
- Cross-team pairing with SAPI team to help them submit a PR for `share-service` command
- Exploring server-side app manifest support with CAPI team
- Starting exploration how to make "v3" app commands the default
- Features starting soon:
  - Support symlinks in app files for v2-push
  - Droplet upload
  - Authentication with client id & secret (no user)
- Further out:
  - TCP port range support for router groups. ([Draft release notes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/143621081))

## CF Feature Roadmap Review

See [this proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K7t_p_NT2F7_Dk3eiv7_g1v3rzFE2GLbTQZTY_V-Les/edit#) for background of this section.

Delivered When? | What?
------|------
*Recently Completed* | - V3 app features (multi-process, multi-buildpack) exposed in [cf CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.32.0)
|| - Started two-month deprecation period for cf-release ([proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KLl4UIQbl92SvYom4fO-LcEoMK1D45KmjA988MwnOR4/edit?usp=sharing))
||
*Soon* | **cf-deployment GA:**
|| - Droplet upload with cf CLI
|| - CredHub credential generation & rotation for CF components
|| - Service instance sharing
|| - Ensure route integrity via instance-identity credentials (Diego, Routing, Garden)
|| - Garden will stop requiring root privileges, begin clock on ending support for privileged containers
|| - Use layered filesystems instead of streaming-in for droplets (expected to lead to performance improvements especially for use cases involving large droplets)
||
*Next* | - GrootFS (OCI-compliant rootfs downloader)
|| - Sharing service instances across orgs and spaces (Services API)
|| - Zero-downtime app updates (CAPI, Diego)
|| - Deprecation of Consul for management plane service discovery (Infrastructure, RelInt, BOSH)
||
*Future* | - Improve reliability of placing large-footprint app instances with less system capacity (Diego)
|| 

*Above are plans, not commitments, and may change without notice.*
