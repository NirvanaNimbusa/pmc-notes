## PMC Lifecycle Activities


## Discussion

- Eric M: PSA, incubator != experimental
	- Active projects should move repos to cloudfoundry and make any new repos there.

## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per

- Continuing work on V3 commands (`v3-ssh`)
  - Expecting subsequent releases to apply user feedback to v3 commands, as well as taking advantage of post-GA CC V3 API improvements.
- Progress on `push` refactor([Draft release notes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/151113529)):
  - Exploring alternative solutions to app manifest inheritence and global attributes. May ask CF community for input soon.
  - Working on route flags (`-n/--hostname`, `--no-hostname`, etc.)
  - Calling back to old `push` implementation for app manifests used in combination with inheritence, global attributes, route flags or domain/domains/host/hosts/no-hostname attributes so we can start releasing it for user evaluation.
- Completed `service` refactor and explored `services` refactor in preparation of service instance sharing support, with SAPI and CAPI teams
- Exploring server-side app manifest support with CAPI team
- Further out:
  - Authentication with client id & secret (no user)
  - TCP port range support for router groups. ([Draft release notes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/143621081))
  - Droplet upload
  - Last login time displayed on `login`

### Garden - Julz Friedman

 - Currently:
 	- Garden peas work approaching first MVP (custom per-process images/mounts)
 	- Rootless complete and about to be enabled in PWS
 	- OCI phase 1 working end to end, beginning benchmarking
 - Next:
 	- Second milestone of Garden peas work (per-process custom limits and metrics)
 	- Supporting OCI images / remote root filesystem layers on Windows
	- OCI phase 2 experiments

### GrootFS - George Lestaris


### Garden-Windows - A William Martin


### Diego - Eric Malm

- Docker app lifecycle launcher sets DATABASE_URL after service-credential interpolation
- diego-release now compatible with BPM v0.2.0
- Cell rep state response includes more complete info about the cell's workload
- De-consuled CF now running in Diego CI; final ops-file changes are on cf-deployment develop
- Working on pushing new instance-identity certs to in-container Envoy proxies via their Listener Discovery Service API
- Working on adjusting container memory allocations, usage reporting to account for Envoy memory overhead

## CF Feature Roadmap Review

See [this proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K7t_p_NT2F7_Dk3eiv7_g1v3rzFE2GLbTQZTY_V-Les/edit#) for background of this section.

Delivered When? | What?
------|------
*Recently Completed* | - V3 app features (multi-process, multi-buildpack) exposed in [cf CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.32.0)
|| - Container networking exposed in [cf CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.30.0)
||
*Soon* | **cf-deployment GA:**
|| - Start of 2 month deprecation period for cf-release ([proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KLl4UIQbl92SvYom4fO-LcEoMK1D45KmjA988MwnOR4/edit?usp=sharing))
|| - CF Release Integration team helping community to migrate
|| - CredHub credential generation & rotation for CF components
|| - Service instance sharing
|| - Ensure route integrity via instance-identity credentials (Diego, Routing, Garden)
|| - Garden will stop requiring root privileges, begin clock on ending support for privileged containers
|| - Use layered filesystems instead of streaming-in for droplets (expected to lead to performance improvements especially for use cases involving large droplets)
||
*Next* | - GrootFS (OCI-compliant rootfs downloader)
|| - Droplet upload with cf CLI
|| - Sharing service instances across orgs and spaces (Services API)
|| - Zero-downtime app updates (CAPI, Diego)
|| - Deprecation of Consul for management plane service discovery (Infrastructure, RelInt, BOSH)
||
*Future* | - Improve reliability of placing large-footprint app instances with less system capacity (Diego)
|| 

*Above are plans, not commitments, and may change without notice.*
