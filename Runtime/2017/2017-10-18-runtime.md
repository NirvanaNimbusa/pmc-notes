## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per

- Continuing work on V3 commands (`v3-ssh`)
    - Expecting subsequent releases to apply user feedback, as well as taking advantage of post-GA CC V3 API improvements.
- Progress on `push` refactor([Draft release notes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/151113529)):
  - Ran and passed CATS.
  - Calling back to old `push` implementation for outstanding features so we can start releasing it for user evaluation (especially app manifest inheritance, global attributes, and route attributes other than "routes"). 
  - Working on last outstanding `push` feature: route related flags (`-d`, `--hostname`, ...). 
- Dr. Max left our team but may return to continue work on i18n support and interaction with translation contributors.
- Started `service` refactor in preparation of service instance sharing support, with SAPI and CAPI teams
- Further out:
  - Authentication with client id & secret (no user)
  - TCP port range support for router groups. ([Draft release notes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/143621081))
  - Droplet upload
  - Last login time displayed on `login`

### Garden - Julz Friedman

 - Completed: tightened some directory permissions in preparation for hardened stemcell support
 - Completed: tightened permissions and ownership of garden socket
 - Completed: rootless mode changes UID range to begin at 65536, avoiding any container UID overlapping with any host UID
 - Completing: Let's get ready to rootless! Rootless track complete, ready to deploy in test environments, sent email informing cf-dev and starting transition
    - This starts the clock on ending support for privileged containers in multi-tenant environments
 - Ongoing: OCI Phase One passing CATs, starting on performance tests
 - Ongoing: Garden Peas track progressing well, now possible to create peas (processes in container with their own root filesystem/resource limits), stream IO, get exit code.
 - Next: Talking with garden-windows team about enabling Docker/OCI image support on windows
 - Next: OCI Phase Two experiments

### GrootFS - George Lestaris


### Garden-Windows - A William Martin

- cf ssh into Windows 2016 containers completed, at long last.
- IronFrame pseudo-bind-mount implementation was replaced with a symlink-based impl in support of instance identity creds
- Buildpack App Lifecycle now supported on Windows 2012R2, finally retiring the long-standing Windows App Lifecycle
- Updated the build of windows2016fs-release with online (default in cf-deployment) and offline versions.

### Diego - Eric Malm

- Instance-identity credentials work on Windows 2012 cells
- Buildpack and Docker app lifecycle launchers can fetch service credentials from CredHub if CC tells them to
- Can opt into gorouter-to-envoy TLS communication (until instance-identity certs expire)
- Explored expected memory overhead of per-container Envoy proxy: should be no more than 5 MB in most cases
- Finished converting Diego components to use new loggregator clients
- Upgraded Golang to v1.9.1
- Updated BBS benchmarks to work with LRP convergence enabled
- Upcoming:
  - Run system container processes (long-running healthchecks, Envoy) as Garden sidecars
  - Start implementing APIs for rolling updates of LRPs
  - Investigate rebalancing strategies for placing large app instances


### Routing - Shannon Coen

- Route Integrity still in progress
- BBR in progress
- Golang 1.9 upgrade delivered
- Istio+Envoy boshification starting asap

### Infrastructure - Evan Farrar

#### `consul-release`
- no functional changes

#### `etcd-release`
- no functional changes

#### `bosh-bootloader` (a.k.a `bbl`)
- Streamlined the IaaS arguments on `bbl up`: `--gcp-project-id` and `--gcp-zone` have been deprecated and will be removed in bbl 6.0)
- Working on workflows for isolation segments, bosh-lite, and VPC CIDR adjustment
- Working on extracting our jumpbox/SOCKS5 proxy code into the BOSH CLI itself

### Release Integration - David Sabeti

#### `cf-release`
- No updates

#### `cf-deployment`
- Ops-files for deploying CredHub and BOSH DNS
- Ops-file for ensuring TLS validation on deployments with valid or otherwise trusted certificates
- `locket` is deployed by default.
- Migration from cf-release
  - Fleshing out documentation for the transition to cf-deployment
  - We have a few ops-files for managing different workflows for migrating the syslog components.
    cf-release still uses `syslog_drain_binder`, but cf-deployment has moved on to [cf-syslog-drain-release](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-syslog-drain-release).
    The tooling should allow for a few different workflows during the migration, each with the different trade-offs regarding syslog downtime and deployment complexity.
  - `cf-deployment-transition` has an ops-file that keeps etcd for the duration of the transition.
    Now that cf-deployment has removed etcd but cf-release still requires it,
    operators will need to keep etcd during the rolling deploy that migrates from cf-release to cf-deployment.
    This ops-file will accomplish that, and the very next deploy after migrating can be done without the ops-file,
    resulting in a cf-deployment-based environment that deploys no etcd.

#### `cf-acceptance-tests`
- No updates

#### `cf-smoke-tests`
- No updates

#### `nats-release`
- No updates

### postgres-release - Valeria Perticara

- Delivered [v21](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/postgres-release/releases/tag/v21) that contains some bug fixes
- Reinforcing client authentication configuration by optionally disable the trust authentication for local connections
- Going to move PostgreSQL upgrade code into pre-start to reduce monit start phase duration


### HAProxy - Geoff Franks

No Updates

### MySQL - Marco Nicosia

- No updates.

### Loggregator - Adam Hevenor

### UAA - Sree Tummidi

### CAPI - Greg Cobb

- Released [capi-release 1.44.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release/releases/tag/1.44.0)
    - Improved BBR support
    - Add support for using Credhub as a service credential store
- Worked with CLI and SAPI for first set of service instance sharing commands

### Services API - Matthew McNeeney

- Feature flag for service sharing added so this can be enabled/disabled within a foundation
- CC APIs completed for v3 share and unshare
- Working on v2 APIs for space summary and listing service instances
- Moved sharing user provided services out of scope for v1

### Permissions - Chris Brown

### PERSI - Julian Hjortshoj

### Container Networking - Usha Ramachandran

### Bits-Service - Simon Moser

- still waiting on CAPI regarding the definition/agreement on the droplet flows 
- in the meantime resumed works around TLS/mTLS for the bits-service
- low productivity week of CF summit 

## CF Feature Roadmap Review
See [this proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K7t_p_NT2F7_Dk3eiv7_g1v3rzFE2GLbTQZTY_V-Les/edit#) for background of this section.

Delivered When? | What?
------|------
*Recently Completed* | - V3 app features (multi-process, multi-buildpack) exposed in [cf CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.32.0)
|| - Container networking exposed in [cf CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.30.0)
||
*Soon* | **cf-deployment GA:**
|| - Start of 2 month deprecation period for cf-release ([proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KLl4UIQbl92SvYom4fO-LcEoMK1D45KmjA988MwnOR4/edit?usp=sharing))
|| - CF Release Integration team helping community to migrate
|| - CredHub credential generation & rotation for CF components
|| - Service instance sharing
|| - Ensure route integrity via instance-identity credentials (Diego, Routing, Garden)
|| - Garden will stop requiring root privileges, begin clock on ending support for privileged containers
|| - Use layered filesystems instead of streaming-in for droplets (expected to lead to performance improvements especially for use cases involving large droplets)
||
*Next* | - GrootFS (OCI-compliant rootfs downloader)
|| - Droplet upload with cf CLI
|| - Sharing service instances across orgs and spaces (Services API)
|| - Zero-downtime app updates (CAPI, Diego)
|| - Deprecation of Consul for management plane service discovery (Infrastructure, RelInt, BOSH)
||
*Future* | - Improve reliability of placing large-footprint app instances with less system capacity (Diego)
|| 

*Above are plans, not commitments, and may change without notice.*
