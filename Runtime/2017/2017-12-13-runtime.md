## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Dies KÃ¶per
- Closed app manifest simplification survey with 135 responses. Preparing analysis and plan of action to share with CF community.
- Preparing to release cf CLI 6.33.1 ([Tracker release marker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/153495841)):
  - Fixes two regressions from release 6.33.0, adds support for symlinks in app files for v2-push.
- Merged SAPI PRs for `share-service` command; awaiting CAPI release that supports the relevant APIs
- Made decision on how we'll make "v3" app commands the default: we'll detect the user's CC version and execute commands as v2 or v3 as appropriate; continuing our exploration for how to implement 
- Features starting soon:
  - TCP port range support for router groups. ([Draft release notes](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/143621081))
  - Authentication with client id & secret (no user)
  - Make `v2-push` the default `push` 
- Further out:
  - Droplet upload
  - Last login time displayed on `login`

## CF Feature Roadmap Review

See [this proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K7t_p_NT2F7_Dk3eiv7_g1v3rzFE2GLbTQZTY_V-Les/edit#) for background of this section.

Delivered When? | What?
------|------
*Recently Completed* | - V3 app features (multi-process, multi-buildpack) exposed in [cf CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases/tag/v6.32.0)
|| - cf-deployment GA; Started two-month deprecation period for cf-release ([announcement](https://lists.cloudfoundry.org/g/cf-dev/message/7535))
||
*Soon* | - CredHub credential generation & rotation for CF components
|| - Service instance sharing
|| - Ensure route integrity via instance-identity credentials (Diego, Routing, Garden)
|| - Garden will stop requiring root privileges, begin clock on ending support for privileged containers
|| - Use layered filesystems instead of streaming-in for droplets (expected to lead to performance improvements especially for use cases involving large droplets)
||
*Next* | - GrootFS (OCI-compliant rootfs downloader)
|| - Sharing service instances across orgs and spaces (Services API)
|| - Zero-downtime app updates (CAPI, Diego)
|| - Deprecation of Consul for management plane service discovery (Infrastructure, RelInt, BOSH)
|| - Droplet upload with cf CLI
||
*Future* | - Improve reliability of placing large-footprint app instances with less system capacity (Diego)
||

*Above are plans, not commitments, and may change without notice.*
