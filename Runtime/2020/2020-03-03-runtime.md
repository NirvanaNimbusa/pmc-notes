### Diego - Josh Collins
- considering/testing the `**bin-pack-first-fit**` PR from @pommi to allow operators to adjust the auctioneer placement algo so it favors placement based on the cell-index (bosh's spec.index). Resulting in slightly less even distribution of apps across the available diego-cells and larger available chunks of memory on the remaining cells - [here's the PR](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/diego-release/pull/448/files#diff-239d35f9a2490d1440a4188d5caad167R32)
