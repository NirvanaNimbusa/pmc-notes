## PMC Lifecycle Activities


## Discussion

- Dieu Cao: updates on repo default-branch changes
  - Chris Clark: GitHub making those changes easier to coordinate before the end of the year; seems sensible to wait a few months for that process to be easier
- Chris: will ping project leads about project office hours during EU Summit
  - also advertising involvement in hands-on labs
