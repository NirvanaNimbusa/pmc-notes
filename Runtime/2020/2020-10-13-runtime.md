## Backlog Reviews

### CLI - Zach Robinson
#### In progress:
#### Pending Release:
- [cf CLI v6.53.0](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/174832791)
**NOTE:** the CLI v6.53.0 binary is available for download GitHub, but the overall release hasn't been officially accepted because of an issue preventing CLI docs from being updated. We expect resolution within the next week.
  - Fix `cf login` regression whereby cf login exits non-zero when executed when no api has been targeted - [issue](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/issues/2011)
- Increasing discoverability/understanding of `cf cancel-deployment` as a means to recover from a "stuck" rolling deployment.
  - several enhancements have been identified
  - team will next interview users to invalidate ideas
- [cf CLI v7.2.0](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/story/show/174832798)

  - Highlights (see release story above for details)
    - `cf revision` (new command) provides app revision details
    - several `cf rollback` and `cf revisions` enhancements
    - add `revision` name/value pair to output from `cf app`, `cf push`, `cf start`, `cf restart`, `cf restage`, and `cf scale`
    - Fix `cf login` regression whereby cf login exits non-zero when executed when no api has been targeted - [issue](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/issues/2011)
