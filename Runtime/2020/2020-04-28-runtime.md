Highlights inlcude haproxy v1.9.15, removal of deprecated properties, revamped syslog support, tunable maxrewrite to support large headers, and reloading of configs (out of band to BOSH/monit) without restarting the haproxy process. 

- [haproxy-boshrelease v10.1.0](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/haproxy-boshrelease/releases/tag/v10.1.0) was released. Adds support for watching/loading certificates that are managed by a process external to haproxy-boshrelease.
